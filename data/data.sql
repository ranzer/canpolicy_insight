If they do not plan to do so, I\'d expect them to be clear and transparent with Canadians about why. They have agreed with my recommendation. Time will tell how they implement the recommendation.I think it\'s a fundamental rule that if you\'re involved in a public organization, you should not be seen to be personally benefiting from public funds. There were definitely at least two projects that we deemed ineligible that were cases in which a conflict of interest had been declared and the person continued to vote. The National Research Council will make sure they have that expertise as they evaluate, based on merit, what every project should receive. There are two things with the contribution agreement between the federal government and the foundation that really sets out how they should determine eligibility.Mr. Chair, I\'m not sure I can respond at that granular level. I\'ll see if the team can do some research. We looked at the process the foundation had in place. At times there were conflicts of interest that were well managed, and we highlighted the 90 that were not. I think there was a breakdown in communication here about things that really were not eligible to be funded under the contribution agreement. I don\'t believe that organization received funding.

In the last fiscal year, board members don\'t receive bonuses. No bonuses were paid to the executive team this past fiscal year.There was no direction from within the department or from the minister\'s office regarding setting up a seed fund.

We want to make sure that every piece of information that we obtain is obtained in a legal fashion so that we can incorporate it into an investigation. If it leads to charges, it could be used in a judicial procedure.There are multiple investigations going on. We have a responsibility to make sure that we protect not only the people we are investigating, but witnesses and whatnot, for fear of intimidation. The way the Office of the Auditor General conducts its investigations and obtains information is different from the way the police do it.

We want to make sure that any document that\'s brought into an investigation is done properly. Everything we produce in a criminal investigation must be disclosable and obtained legally. The documents that are tabled here, at the committee, are subject to parliamentary privilege. If we receive information that leads us to such lists, for example, the situation is made more complex by the fact that this information is then protected by parliamentaryprivilege. I would question the independence of the police in all of this.I\'m not aware of the discussion that took place or if there\'s an appetite to share it with the RCMP. We are currently investigating several files that are looking at the procurement process. That could lead to an element of corruption, but at this point in time, I\'m not saying we\'re anywhere close to that. If any evidence brings us forward to a criminal accusation, we will act accordingly. The RCMP\'s investigation can extend internationally, in collaboration with our partners. There is nothing to indicate that the investigation will lead to tax havens.The budget for the organization is $48.9 million, but the pot of money comes into the organization and it\'s not always dedicated to a certain type of offence that we\'re investigating. The RCMP has resources in which the environment in which we operate shifts quite rapidly, and we prioritize the files that we have, keeping in mind that public safety is the number one priority.

(34,451453793663979901,'There are so many best practices out there that boards can use to help establish what their conflict of interest policies look like. This is about ensuring that from a public perception, individuals never appear to have put themselves in a position where they may benefit from public funds. When you\'re involved with public funds or in the public service, you need to be held to a higher set of standards. In the 88 cases that involved directors, there were 10 directors. Out of the 10, seven were Governor in Council appointees.Audit found significant lapses in Sustainable Development Technology Canada\'s governance and stewardship of public funds. The foundation awarded $59 million to 10 projects that did not meet key requirements set out in the contribution agreements between the government and the foundation. The report also found the foundation did not have an effective system for recording conflict of interest declarations or the measures taken in that regard. The department was unable to ensure that the funds were spent in accordance with the terms of the contribution agreement and did not monitor conflicts of interest.I\'m concerned about the unintended consequences the motion might have on my free and unfettered access to public servants, Crown corporations, departments, and agencies. The board of directors had 15 members. A group of members I\'ll call them a member council, but that\'s not their official title was put in place to name half of the board, but also to do things like name the external auditors. There could be many conflicts of interest in one project. Some of the $58 million is already included in those conflicts.I think social media impacts every organization with the misinformation or disinformation that might be out there. I hope that Canadians turn to the information my office provides knowing that we are a trusted source of information. We\'re here, ultimately, to support parliamentarians in holding the government to account, and we should be doing that with them by our side. I think we were raising a few things. There was no target set in what should be a reasonable target when it comes to determining the environmental benefits. Part of our conclusion was based on the fact that we looked at completed projects, and the received benefits were lower than what had been estimated.',131,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

We will not necessarily, in all cases, come to the same conclusion about whether or not an organization has been following the rules. I already testified today on recoveries, and we see that as pretty cut and dried: We need to be taking action. We committed that we\'ll come back to the committee to explain what we\'re doing in that space.Minister: I would like to strongly underline my department\'s commitment to sound management of public funding. The record shows that Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada moved swiftly as soon as we were made aware of the allegations of mismanagement at SDTC. We are in full agreement with her findings, including the recommendations directed to ISED. Indeed, we\'re already quite advanced in implementing improvements. We agree and are already well advanced in putting in place structural changes in how we oversee clean-tech funding.The minister was briefed on the results of the fact-finding exercise and the next steps on September 27, 2023. The challenges identified at SDTC revolved almost entirely around its arms\'-length independent governance model. By placing its programming inside the public service, the ability to scrutinize and ensure adherence to key government policies will be much higher. The department is responsible for clean technology programs with organizations like SDTC. It is also responsible for working in the field of the organizations, but both offices are both offices.The board of directors of the Sustainable Development Technology Canada must have a background in the clean-tech industry. By bringing the organization under the ambit of the National Research Council, you largely eliminate that problem. I completely agree with the Auditor General about the necessity of ISED having stronger oversight of its contribution agreement, but from a legal point of view, ISED and the government have no ability to appoint members to the member council of SDTC. I hope all members agree that IRAP is generally regarded as a very well-run program and is very strongly supported by the business sector.I was made aware of these concerns about the improper documentation of a conflict of interest through the whistle-blower process and the review by RCGT. We agree that there needs to be enhanced oversight of the activities of SDTC, particularly with regard to adherence to the contribution agreement. We have already made a lot of changes to the organization that already exists, which may put new structures and processes in place that are much more robust than before. The idea is to move everything to the National Research Council of Canada. The process for granting the companies these funds has already started.Mr. Chair, I should make sure that the record is clear. The Auditor General made an independent decision to conduct an audit. This is the kind of contract we have with SDTC, which is legally at arm\'s length. There\'s a new board that\'s been given very explicit instructions to up their game on oversight. In the short term, we do want to get funding restarted, but with a much greater level of probity and accountability as per the recommendations of Ms Hogan and the various reviews that have been done.No, Mr. Chair. I accept the concerns the member has raised. I don\'t have a response. I want to point out that the plan consists first of transferring management of SDTC to the NRCC. It will then be several years before the final transfer to the new innovation agency. However, as I said in my remarks at the start of this meeting, SDTC was even more independent than a Crown corporation, which must comply with a whole framework of rules and structures that did not apply to SDTC.Mr. Simon Kenned: The principal responsibility for enforcing these rules was with the board. Our oversight was not sufficient to catch the fact the board wasn\'t fulfilling its duties. Mr. Michael Cooper: The reason that this organization is being moved to the NRC is that it\'s very. unusual in the stable of organizations that we support.Mr. Mitch Davies: Ultimately, we are both responsible, along with our team at the National Research of Canada, for managing the department and I am prepared to answer questions.Deputy minister says he is in 100% agreement with need for increased probity and additional scrutiny. No evidence of deliberate malfeasance, criminality, etc., he says. Move to the NRC is a major step towards eliminating what is a kind of ongoing problem, he adds. Deputy minister: We believe that the fundamental structure of this organization has contributed to these problems. He says he has written a written follow-up plan to the public accounts committee to respond to the Auditor General\'s findings.I think there have been some very incendiary allegations made. As officials, we have a duty to look at the facts and the evidence and make judgments on the basis of the facts on the ground. There\'s a very strong interest in not having the business sector that has been assisted by this funding be harmed in the long run because of the problems that have been identified. There has already been some funding that\'s been going out to organizations. That has happened only when there has been fairly extensive diligence to demonstrate that the funding is not going out.',131,'Mr. Simon Kennedy'),

We have to stop that, at least going forward. That has nothing to do with police charges. They broke the SDTC act and the Conflict of Interest Act,\" the deputy minister says.Auditor General: 186 transactions approved by the board or by directors who had a conflict of some sort, declared or undeclared. $319 million out of $856 million, which means that somewhere around 40% of the money allocated in the period you audited was conflicted in some way. $58 million maybe there was overlap in funds that did not meet the contribution agreement, which included, I believe, the COVID payments. These Liberal appointees either were not complying generally with normal governance practices, or were going outside of the rules that Parliament and ISED set up.Mr. Kennedy: I would expect that the department, the deputy and the minister would be informed. It\'s pretty clear in the Conflict of Interest Act with regard to public office holders. When almost half the money going out the door is conflicted amounts in terms of the government-appointed board members, that is not one person leaving the room and there\'s an exception. They\'re all working and getting conflicts, and it\'s the culture that causes a problem.

Canada really needs to get a handle on oil and gas and transportation. Together these account for more than 50% of total emissions.. We\'re not in the business of setting a target, but we\'re in theBusiness of assessing performance towards the committed target, which is 40% to 45%.Emissions in Canada are higher today than when this country and the world first committed to fighting climate change at the United Nations Earth Summit more than 30 years ago. Plans have come and gone, and Canada has yet to meet any of its targets. We found that measures needed to meet the 2030 target were delayed by departments or were not prioritized for implementation.

(64,451453793663979961,'All First Nations were offered a significant opportunity by Canada to be directly involved in the development of Bill C-61. Our Nations provided extensive legal and historical submissions about our Treaty water rights at the outset of the consultation process. It\'s challenging our systems and institutions to share power and to listen to first nations about what they want to see in the governance of not just their community but this country. They are valuable partners. We were able to get significant changes made including broadening the recognition of our inherent right of self-government to include all aspects of water in general.Indigenous Services minister: Report underscores the importance of continuing to work with first nations in addressing the socio-economic gaps. Minister: Issues pointed out in the report can be resolved only through the work of true partnership with indigenous people and the full self-determination of first nations. Indigenous Services Canada spent a historic amount on infrastructure last year, the most the department had ever spent, and we\'re on track to spend even more. Budget 2024 recently proposed $426 million over five years for first nations housing and related infrastructure on reserve.I will say that all federally funded housing on reserve must meet or beat the national building code and must demonstrate compliance as a condition for that funding. The lack of infrastructure in first nations is a result of a colonial country that has failed to live up to its obligations treaty or otherwise to first nations people. Our government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, decided we would tackle reconciliation in a real and sincere way. I want to thank the NDP and the Bloc for asking questions about indigenous people because it keeps it on the radar of Canadians.Since 2016, we\'ve invested over $10 billion to support indigenous housing projects. In budget 2024, 25% of the new spend is on indigenous priorities. When a prime minister says reconciliation will be at the core of what we do, the hard work begins. When we start to realize that we\'re each other\'s people and come together in ways that are at all levels of government, there is such opportunity for a better economy in Canada. That is how we are approaching eliminating the Indian Act.I think we know who suffers the most. I think it\'s represented in the kinds of historic compensation that we\'ve seen under our government. The difference is this government is not only no longer hiding from the legacy of the colonialism of this country but is trying to form those better relationships. Many first nations people don\'t trust health care systems that were intended to be for all, but which, in fact, indigenous people have been excluded from for decades since their institution. I will say that we\'ll continue to work with them on the successful funding.There\'s an ongoing commitment by the federal government under the Liberals to keep reconciliation centred in the work we do. There are many barriers to investing that capital in first nations endeavours. I would say that the history of Canada has been one of economic exclusion of first nations people. This is a hard pattern to break. The good news is that I sense this in capital markets and corporate Canada there is a growing recognition of the economic advantage of reconciliation. I look forward to the next steps in this work.MP Nater, encourage you to vote for any measures that increase spending for indigenous priorities. MP Bradford, I would ask you the same, I suppose. I forgot your community. If Kitchener all of a sudden were uninhabitable, it would be a very emotional thing to contemplate leaving.

First nations are the only jurisdictions in this country that have to guarantee every single loan or mortgage our members make for housing. Many of our communities are in debt with mortgaging for housing, because social housing doesn\'t meet the needs. Home ownership is not for every first nation, but it absolutely has to be part of the equation going forward. The Assembly of First Nations did a tremendous amount of work over the last number of years to identify what those needs are.Y nonhchia offers an opportunity to diversify the housing offerings that first nations have. Currently, most first nations wait for our funding allocation from CMHC and ISC. Y nonh chia takes the burden from the band council of having to be responsible for guaranteeing and managing every single loan. It builds on individual financial and credit strength to provide housing finance. The interest is there, and the IFI network is ready, willing and able to do it.

There are initiatives out there, like Manny Jules\' property ownership initiative. I know that the Nisga\'a people have decided to create a form of private tenure. There is all kinds of experimentation. I think a lot of these have to be community-led, to be very clear, not government-imposed.I joined Indian Affairs in 2006, and my biggest disappointment is that the Indian Act is still there. I would hope you would all make a commitment that the next parliament, the 45th Parliament, is the parliament that repeals theIndian Act. That is one of the fundamental issues that\'s obstructing progress on first nations communities. I think the fundamentals underlying this issue are the same ones my predecessors had. The fundamentals are broken. Until Parliament gets around to changing legislation and structures, the department is pedalling into the wind.There are 41 million Canadians, but only 338 soon to be 343 of you, to change the legislation. I believe that after the next election, the elected government will be able to pass a bill simply stipulating that over the next 10 years, the Indian Act will be withdrawn. Removing or reducing the barriers that prevent communities and their governments from accessing private capital and financial markets can yield excellent results. There are barriers to obtaining guarantees, mortgages and insurance in particular.Everything being done in Quebec amounts to a type of workaround.Housing and infrastructure go together: land, infrastructure and housing. A department pushing contribution agreements out to first nations is not the tool kit that is going to generate housing and infrastructure. The only real way to get data and change outcomes is to put a lot of conditions into contribution agreements, he says. \"We can\'t keep blaming the Indian Act and not face up to the fact that it is software whose time has come and that we need to move on,\" he adds. \"I think the General Auditor has presented data that makes it look like there was no progress\"I think what you have to look for is ways to get out of the Indian Act, which sits on top of the numbered treaties one through 11 across most of central and western Canada. In all of the north, there are almost 24 modern self-government land claims agreements, and in most of those you have much clearer aboriginal title and ownership of the land base. I think bringing health into Indigenous Services was a good idea, but it has its limitations, because it\'s still a department pushing the contribution-agreements model.Workarounds and attempts to create paths out of the Indian Act have been introduced by every government over the last 40 years. The First Nations Finance Authority is an attempt to do that. There\'s legal ambiguity in the law right now about who owns the physical assets on reserves, which makes it very hard to get insurance.

(102,451453793663980037,'A contract issued by Trans Mountain Corporation to McKinsey & Company to provide advice on operations, sort of monthly how to be more efficient and how to save money. That contract was issued on a non-competitive basis. It did not have a limit, but they expected that they would spend about $19 million. To date, they have spent $32 million on that contract. In 90 cases, their records showed that members of the board had declared a conflict of interest and voted on giving funding, and that should not have happened.Audit looked at federal contracts awarded to McKinsey & Company between 2011 and 2023. Total value of contracts awarded totalled $209 million, of which about $200 million was spent. Audit found that organizations awarding the contracts showed a frequent disregard for federal contracting and procurement policies and guidance. Report also looked at whether the foundation managed public funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of contribution agreements and its legislative mandate. Report focused on whether the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had the capacity to effectively enforce laws and protect Canadians online.Audit found breakdowns in response, coordination, tracking and information sharing. Report: Many reports were made to the wrong organizations and that those organizations did not respond to individuals or redirect the reports they received to the appropriate organization. Audit: 71% of the contracts that were issued on a non-competitive basis represent $118 million of contract awards. The RCMP struggled to staff its cybercrime investigative teams and close to one-third of positions across all teams were vacant as of January 2024, the report found.We were looking at whether they had enough people to respond to the reports that were received. Thousands of them were not acted on. In the case of the RCMP, about 30% of their cybercrime investigation team positions are vacant. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission is not included in the national cybercrime strategy. Spam is often the gateway to a cybercrime, so it would be important that they be part of that strategy. The CRTC seized cellphones and information to determine whether anyone violated Canada\'s anti-spam legislation.A report that was received by the CRTC about child sexual exploitation material was not sent to the RCMP. The fact that 71% of contracts are awarded non-competitively concerns me. The frequent non-respect of these rules was all over the 12 years in question, throughout nine out of 10 departments and agencies. It\'s time for the government to really refresh and remind everybody about all the procurement rules and make sure they\'re being followed. Out of the 97 contracts that we looked at, six of them appeared to be designed to suit or to favour McKinsey.A standing offer is meant to be almost like a self-serve. Six out of 97. cases were properly handled, so really what\'s concerning is the 90 that were not properly handled. The way the COVID payments were done, I think, violated two things. One is the conflict of interest rules not being properly followed, since individuals who had conflicts of interest did not recuse themselves from the vote. The government should properly document why contracts are needed, regardless of who they are issued to.About 20 of the contracts used the standing offer. For the others, departments or agencies and Crown corporations used a non-competitive process. I don\'t believe that our findings are unique to McKinsey. I believe that we\'ll likely see that rules weren\'t paid attention to with other professional services contracts, but even more generally around procurement. It\'s about showing transparency and accountability to Canadians. An individual to have benefited from funds shouldn\'t be seen as the public of interest. You need to make sure, as a public service, that you set up your personal life in such a way that they don\'t interfere with your work. SDTC audit found McKinsey accounts for 0.27% of the public service\'s professional services spend. SDTC says public servants should declare potential conflicts of interest before awarding contracts. The government should take a step back and say everyone has to understand the directives and policies, says SDTC. The problems are something that I would expect to see more broadly across professional services and contracting, says the auditor. for more than a decade, SDTC has been auditing contracts.

It is intended to improve the movement of goods across the country by strengthening the network of roads, rails, airports and seaports. At the time of our audit, Transport Canada approved $3.8 billion to fund 181 transportation projects for completion by 2028.

(139,451453793663980111,'I will start, and then I will turn to my colleague to maybe speak to some specific examples of projects that we have under way in collaboration with the Northwest Territories. First and foremost, what I would say is that we try to move as quickly as project proponents, and that includes in terms of the agreement set-up and the agreement negotiation. We are respectful of the fact that oftentimes in doing these projects recipients also have environmental assessments that they need to undertake. With 40 projects valued at $848 million, Quebec is actively participating.The national trade corridors fund supports projects that are designed to help improve Canada\'s supply chain, making it more seamless, efficient and resilient to disruption. More than $4 billion in federal funding has been invested in 213 projects. The projects are under way at ports, airports and highways. They range from infrastructure and construction projects to technical or feasibility studies and to projects that aim to bring partners together to use data and information to alleviate supply chain congestion. The report found that Transport Canada did a good job of designing and implementing the program. It also shared two areas for improvement.The department is tracking the economic impact of the 213 projects it has funded. It is estimating that, through this program, we\'re going to create approximately 95,000 jobs. The program is also helping to ensure that our supply chain is able to withstand the impacts of climate change. It\'s really important to make those investments to have that predictability and that fluidity, but we also have to position our supply Chain and our transportation system to be able to adopt new technology, he says.Mr. Chair, I want to be very careful about not stepping out of my mandate in responding to the question. In my mandate, I\'m responsible for program delivery. I don\'t do the safety and security oversight. What I can tell you, though, is that rail safety is a priority for Transport Canada. It is something we are committed to. There are a number of measures that the department has put in place, like lowering train speeds in metropolitan areas. In terms of strengthening train security and uncontrolled movements, there are anumber of different requirements that are put into place.No, that has not been our experience. To date, we\'ve only had eight project proponents withdraw. Oftentimes, when they withdraw, it could be a variety of factors. Sometimes the scope of the project has changed or project financing has changed. There may be cost escalations that they are no longer able to bear. We do consider the impacts of climate change, when we look at project proposals. We look at how some of these projects will help ensure climate change resiliency and whether the project will result in a reduction of GHG emissions.Mr. Chair, what I can say is that we recognize, through the national trade corridors fund, that road infrastructure is a critical component of Canada\'s transportation system. Oftentimes, there are benefit agreements that can accrue from various projects. We have an example in the port of Prince Rupert, where the Metlakatla are actively participating. You can also see how reconciliation and participation are being advanced. We took a very evidence-based approach in selecting and ultimately recommending the projects.Ministers are able to choose from a list of projects, including ones that are not recommended, as long as they are eligible and they meet the terms and conditions of the program. When we provide advice and recommendations, we provide the project, so it\'s all merit based. All of the projects that we have recommended have been meritorious. I think we made a mistake when making adjustments after the national committee meeting. We did not properly document the reasons why we made slight adjustments in the score given to such a project.In terms of an eighth call, I don\'t have a line of sight at this moment of when we would be doing another call. What we seek to do is to try to have some consistency, but as well to be agile and adapt to where we feel the Canadian economy is. LNG is something that would be eligible if it were able to demonstrate that it met the merits of the call, so it\'s not something that we are prioritizing but it is not somethingThat\'s very kind, Mr. Chair, but I must confess that I have lost my train of thought.',124,'Ms. Stephanie H bert'),

This is very strange behaviour from a government that has a track record of spending public money like there\'s no tomorrow.In Saint John, New Brunswick, in September 2022, Mr. Sorbara spent $2,330.62. As well, in Whitehorse, Mrs. Shanahan spent, I believe, in excess of $5,000. The Liberal party\'s caucus retreat in New Brunswick in 2022 cost taxpayers $428,000 and change. Some of it was billed to the House of Commons, and some expenses for staffers in ministers\' offices and the Prime Minister\'s office were billed to those offices. Also, the figures included $43,292 in expenses for MPs\' designated travellers.',123,'Mr. Jake Stewart'),

I think the government will always need the support of the private sector as it\'s trying to do transformative and big-system changes. Finding a co-operative way forward would behoove both industry and the government.I have many thoughts on Mr. Firth\'s response and his appearance before the House. None of them are of relevance to this committee.I will begin by taking issue with repeated references to my having lied, fibbed or been demonstrably dishonest. No business advantage has been sought or received as a result of this arrangement, and I have always followed all conflict of interest requirements of myself. We were asked by the Public Health Agency to develop the app to replace a paper process so that it could get critical health information and pass it along to provinces in a timely manner. This was not planned for in any way. There was no budget and no project plan, or any of the other things we would normally have in place for the development of a tool like this.I did not access anything or take any advantage that would put me in any conflict of interest. The one document I was actually provided with, besides looking at my emails and calendars, was the ATIP that was provided to OGGO. As a government employee, I was required to submit hours to the agency. I submitted one day\'s worth of hours, and they chose to give me a paycheque. My initial response was that I did not want to get paid. They asked for my time and I\'m happy to give it back.I\'ve reviewed my emails, and I have no evidence that anything has been changed or removed, from what I remember. I was not involved in the vendor selection process, and nothing was brought to my attention about allegations of wrongdoing by Botler during my tenure. We were in constant contact with our frontline officers and the regions during the pandemic. Anything that wasn\'t working, we tried to take into account, to make sure the border process would be as smooth as possible. We\'re always trying to rebalance the workforce in terms of retirements, attrition, workload changes.I have no knowledge of any emails from Ms. O\'Gorman about the statement of fact or the allegations. I would get involved in a contracting process only if it required ministerial authority or briefing or a Treasury Board submission. There was remarkable flexibility on behalf of the workforce and all of my colleagues in other departments to do the best we could. I make no excuses for the lack of documentation and the other things that the Auditor General found in her study. That\'s not acceptable. I\'m sure that, as we move forward, the agency is putting in measures to make sure that doesn\'t happen again.Ms. Dutt was free to email me directly, and she did not. My officials dealt with her complaints, and Ms. O\'Gorman dealt with the subsequent issue around their complaint. If the allegations of wrongdoing had been brought to my attention, I would have done something about it, but they were not. I was not on casual employment status in October when I apologized, and yes, it is normal practice for people to be given access to their information through casual employment.I have no recollection of meeting any of these contractors in or outside of the workplace.I take umbrage that I\'m being referred to as double-dipping to prepare for this committee. There was no ongoing source of funds to hire border services officers. This was a very complicated app. There were many, many different versions, which were not able to be predicted in advance.

For our study on ArriveCAN, the following witnesses have declined our invitation: Harriet Solloway, from the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada; John Ossowski; Paul Girard; and the RCMP. Mr. Desjarlais, could I get some language in? You would like to make an addition that says what? Then you would like the clerk or the chair to provide an estimate of the meeting cost? Mr. Nater, I\'ll recognize you first. There is a point of order.Mr. Nater is not actually asking to spend more money. I\'ve already said that there will be a meeting next Thursday, so I\'m asking.... I am calling this committee back next Thursday. Mr. Desjarlais, for example, you\'re not asking for the cost of the air conditioning to be included. You\'re talking about the actual cost of running the meeting. The analysts will pull together a cost estimate for us as best they can. I think the amendment is before the table.

It would surprise me if you received documents only yesterday. I have secured an understanding with a witness who was approved by this committee. I do not have the papers for that yet, so I\'m not in a position to announce it. It\'s because we\'re adults and we can talk about things that we can keep confidential. I\'ll look for comments, and if I don\'t receive any, I will of course move the meeting in camera.Mr. Desjarlais, I\'m going to pause you. You sent me a note asking for information. I have asked the clerk to send all members the information. Ms. Bradford would like the floor, so I can give you a few minutes.

I mean, for a minister to decline to be held accountable to committees is I think unfortunate. That is why I submitted the motion that is before you. It\'s as simple as that.I think that when we have key witnesses who are refusing to come, who have key testimony related to this study, their attendance ought to be required. I would have hoped, frankly, that Mr. Firth\'s testimony at the bar might be a cautionary tale to those who would rather decline the authority of Parliament. I think this is about accountability.

Are you just trying to have a meeting for the sake of having a meeting? I\'m really not sure what the objective is here, Chair.I agree 100% with what Mr. Desjarlais is saying, which is that responsibility is fiscal. It\'s about taxpayer dollars and how much work we are able to do here for two hours, just so that you\'re able to have these surprise meetings.

It feels like the results are not being felt on the ground, and that is, I think, after successive changes in policy and direction and certainly a massive influx of investment into Indigenous Affairs never before seen in the history of our government.

Half of them are empty meetings. Let\'s schedule one of those. Mr. Nater, I\'m happy to support your motion, but please think about the Canadian taxpayers. This stuff is serious.I would suggest that four days isn\'t a month, and I could bring out a calendar for Mr. Stewart to count the days. I don\'t think your constituents and I\'ll speak directly to your constituents expect you, on one hand, to hold the government accountable for expenditures that are inappropriate, and then at the same time ask the same taxpayer to pay a bunch of money when you could have had that same work done four days later. Let\'s vote on this and just get this over with, because I agree with my Bloc colleague.I\'m happy with going forward, Chair, with next week. You\'ve already spent the money. Let\'s be serious about how much it costs taxpayers to have these meetings. Can we actually summon the minister? If so, I would love to summon her right now.

(209,451453793663980251,'It\'s still sticky and it\'s still elevated. It\'s a big contributor to the above-target inflation right now. That\'s one of the reasons we look at a variety of measures. We\'re particularly focused on core measures, because they trim out the things that are outliers, including in shelter inflation. It is still contributing and it’s still a reality for Canadians. I\'m sorry; I\'m also having trouble hearing you. Okay. I’m sorry. Our policy rate sets the overnight rate. The overnight rate is the rate to which other interest rates are anchored. Really, we set a baseline interest rate.There are different definitions of the supply of money, and they measure different things. Underlying inflation looks to be coming down a little more quickly in Canada. The U.S. economy is relatively stronger compared to the Canadian economy, and inflation is a little stickier ; that\'s the term we would use. For a small open economy like Canada, trade deals are an important part of strengthening our economy. There are different measures of money supply, and there are different monetary aggregates. The measure that includes bank accounts is the measure that people like me have.The bank has an ongoing consultation process. It isn\'t necessarily at each rate decision. We regularly meet with Canadians, with Canadian businesses, with organizations, industry associations. We are regularly talking to Canadians about conditions in the economy. Each decision-making process is quite structured, quite lengthy, very deeply analytical. There was a surplus. Coralia, do you want to go ahead with the total losses from 2020 to 2023? I would characterize our policy decisions in two phases. The first was in March 2020. This was at the very beginning of the pandemic.The losses are generated by the extraordinary monetary policy we took in response to the pandemic. Demographics are definitely one. As people age, they spend more than they save, so it can be upward pressure on inflation. As a result of the conditions I described earlier, we had a number of supply chain problems. We had a global economy shock to the economy with the invasion of Ukraine. It\'s been a very difficult time for Canadian households over the last few years. The combination of high inflation and the response to an increase in interest rates has been very difficult for Canadian families.The Bank of Canada\'s mandate is to steer the Canadian economy in the long-term best interest of Canadians by keeping inflation low and stable. I don\'t have exact numbers in front of me, if you\'re asking me to give you exact data. We annually publish an assessment of financial stability and hold a press availability event we\'ll be doing this year on Thursday this week. We are audited annually by two separate audit firms. The Minister of Finance can, at any time, request an expansion of the scope of those audits or order a special audit.I think it\'s a long-standing tradition to have the monarch on our $20 bill. We do broad consultation on the various images that appear on our currency, including with the indigenous community. We have incorporated their feedback on a number of our bills recently. There\'s a lot of research, both from our own researchers at the bank and from the broader research community. It\'s a very broad, very robust engagement process to get input.

We saw a small expansion into the north, but not much, and no community moving from a tripartite agreement to a self-administered agreement. While one did move right after the end of our audit period, that\'s very little progress for the additional funding that was put into the program with the purpose of expanding it. The problem really stems from gaps in their own data and their information technology systems.The first nations and Inuit policing program was created in 1991. We found that the RCMP did not work in partnership with indigenous communities to provide proactive policing services. Public Safety Canada did not have an approach to allocate funds equitably to communities. The department told us that it relied on the provinces\' or territories\' readiness to fund their share of the program and on past funding received by communities to determine the amounts allocated. In most cases, the RCMP was unable to tell us whether a police officer had spent 100% of their time dedicated to the community.',116,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

It won\'t be just one investment through policing or any of those other programs I just mentioned. One of the efforts that we are trying to pursue in the department is that concentration of expertise and programming in one single place. Our desire is indeed to expand the kind of work we do to be able to engage more directly and consistently with communities, to not rely on just the cycles of how these agreements work.Public Safety Canada is committed to improving the program in collaboration with provinces and territories of jurisdiction and with first nations and Inuit communities. The department has recently aligned the delivery of programs, indigenous policing and community safety policy and engagement considerations into a single branch. Public Safety is also revisiting the program management relationship with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to more readily consider and integrate official availability in program management decisions. In parallel, indigenous-led regional and national engagement sessions have been held over the winter on proposed legislative options to advance the minister\'s mandate.The department has not been able to sustain an IT system that allows us to do the kind of data analytics that we need to do. The department, over time, has not made the investments it needs to make, and those are oftentimes expensive investments. We do not have sufficient funding to cover all of the need in indigenous communities across the land there\'s no question about that. I think we can do better between the two organizations in aligning the work we do and identifying the kinds of resource demands we have.I would say that we don\'t have any difficulty bringing provinces to the table. Part of our struggle is that provinces don\'t report to the federal government. We need to find a better collaborative way to pull together the data that is in the hands of provinces and territories. It\'s a bit cyclical in the sense that some provinces are more active in a given year than others simply by the choices they make.

The AFN has said they\'ve been stonewalled by your ministry.

(262,451453793663980357,'I\'m always happy to listen to the concerns of parliamentarians, whether they be from the House or from the Senate, as we consider what to audit. It is really important that we not be influenced. During my tenure, I can tell you that we have freely chosen what we have audited. Once my reports are made public, they are on the public record. Any individual can use them as they would like. At times, it makes sense. At other times, I think bigger scrutiny is needed on the use of contractors.The Office of the Auditor General of Canada serves Canada primarily through auditing and other work that assists Parliament in its authorization and oversight of government spending and operations. In the 2022-23 fiscal year, parliamentary committees reviewed 88% of our federal and territorial performance audit reports, up from 80% in the prior year. We also made progress on modernizing our IT infrastructure, reducing our environmental footprint, and supporting a healthy and inclusive workplace culture. We will continue to work on several ongoing internal initiatives, such as our engagement with interested parties, our transformation journey.The environment commissioner\'s office does annual financial audits of the federal government as well as the three territorial governments. We do about 90 of those every single year. In performance audits, we go into departments and agencies, depending on the program we might be looking at to determine whether the programs have been managed with due regard to the economy, efficiency and the environment. There are also petitions.Canadians can submit an environmental petition if they want to how the government is handling certain environmental matters. It\'s submitted to us; we ensure that a government department receives that petition.I view the employment equity targets as just the minimum that we should meet. We are exceeding most of them, except for representation around indigenous individuals. It\'s probably due mostly, in my view, to attrition. Our historical attrition rate has been about 10%. In the past few years, that has dropped to around 4%. That is much higher in our working level than it is in our management. That\'s an issue that I know we have to tackle in a real, concrete way in the coming months and years.There is a gap in information that needs to be addressed government-wide. Statistics Canada is doing a lot of great work when it comes to data analytics. A lot of the outdated systems that the government currently has are a bit of a detriment. The need for more nimbleness in funding IT projects, even if it applies to my organization or the government in general, is inhibiting the government from moving forward and doing more in this sphere. It\'s hard to access funding for this, except you have to transition to it.I\'ve really built on some of the priorities of my predecessors, but we have had a really big push since I became Auditor General to ensure that sustainable development goals are considered in everything that we do. We try really hard to keep the lens on racialized and indigenous employees so that we can make sure that we think about all Canadians when we carry out our work. I think there\'s a lot of work to do there not just talking about the goals but actually trying to measure progress and think about how programs are impacting them.',115,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

As of December 31, 2023, funding through the National Housing Strategy has helped First Nations to build, renovate and retrofit close to 34,000 homes on reserves. We recognize that significant strides have been made but that, as the Auditor General of Canada s report notes, there is still a lot more work to do. There remain major disparities between the housing conditions of indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Canada, especially on reserve.The formula in question is subject to a tripartite agreement between the Assembly of First Nations, Indigenous Services Canada and the CMHC. In our response to the Auditor General s report, we said that we would verify it and work to change the formula, but we will not do so unilaterally. As of December 31, 2023, we\'ve committed $6 billion of the $43 billion that has been committed under the national housing strategy to indigenous people and people living in the north.

Hartaj has more than two decades of experience assisting some of the world s largest organizations in matters relating to cybersecurity. We re looking forward to answering your questions. Thank you, Mr. Chair.KPMG initially participated in the CEPS agreement that I mentioned in our opening remarks. We were awarded a spot on that vendor-of-record contracting vehicle in July 2020, and our work was subsequently contracted off that vehicle. The initial TA was through the competitive CEPS vehicle, so that was competitively awarded and then subsequently directed to us. For the Public Health Agency work that was contracted to KPMG, we invoiced about $4.5 million before taxes. We did not do any work on the development of the app itself.I\'m not aware of the answer to that question, but as I said before, KPMG has been very proud to support the federal government for a very long time, for many years, well before this body of work. We find that when clients reach out to ask for consulting support, it\'s typically for two major reasons. One is that they lack the specific expertise or capabilities that are required to address a specific problem. The second reason is that perhaps they need more capacity in a very short period of time to address time-sensitive or urgent requirements.KPMG brought in unique and specialized expertise to the Public Health Agency. We were bringing very specific human-centred design expertise, for instance, to help the government identify the specific experience. We developed journey maps and detailed process design maps to help them think through all of the operational impacts that these new policies and evolving policies under the Quarantine Act would have, not just on government operations and the air travel industry, but also, more importantly, on international travellers, especially on Canadians returning to the country.No staff member or partner is directly compensated for a particular engagement. None of the work that we did, though, had anything to do with the app itself. It was more about how the experience of travellers, the travel industry and the border control measures needed to be changed or updated based on the evolving policies. The Public Health Agency was under an incredible amount of pressure to respond during this time, and we did everything we could to help them do so in a timely manner.

There\'s a security issue related to the findings of the Auditor General on whether or not certain individuals for a certain task authorization were in fact security-cleared.

I accept that. That\'s why we are putting in place all these additional controls and measures. Anything above $40,000 for contract or task authorizations has to come to committee. The amount of $6.1 million was spent with Service Canada at their call centre. That was for individuals returning to Canada who may have had questions around ArriveCAN or questions around the vaccine certification. We do recognize that the majority of the costs were IT-related.We have a standing emergency plan, which was utilized during the pandemic. For any operational activity at the border, we will bring in our emergency management procedures. For example, we had to increase the cleaning of our ports of entry to twice a day from once a day. We had to secure, with the help of the Public Health Agency and PSPC, all of the PPE. We provided it through PPE and, as I\'ve said before, through sanitization cabinets, which are now a standard feature.I fully support the approach of having open, fair and transparent competition to allow all of us to get the best value for money. The ArriveCAN app costs about one dollar, whereas the paper-based process was costing about three dollars. I\'m pleased to say that, unlike what happened during COVID, we discussed that national security exemption at the procurement review committee twice before agreeing to it. I do not believe the CBSA misled the Auditor General. It was very clear who the technical authorities on all of those contracts were.All 900 people with the delegation of financial signing authorities have been retrained. Everyone has undertaken 16.5 hours of training to remind them of what their responsibilities are in contracting. In addition, we have strengthened the conflicts of interest register. We have done a lot already, but we have more to do to identify and address each recommendation that has been made. If wrongdoing is found, then action will be taken. That\'s what I\'m assuring, but I can\'t say at this moment a name because I do not know a name.I think it\'s a really important sort of thing to recognize that we did not do everything right with ArriveCAN. We recognize that, and we accept the recommendations made and are doing something about it. Overall, we did a very difficult job in very difficult times, and I\'m proud of what we did, but we did make some mistakes and will learn from those mistakes. I think it was about six or seven individuals. The director general responsible for that has confirmed with the other government departments that there was no conflict of interest.',111,'Mr. Jonathan Moor'),

A letter of intent between the agencies was signed in July 2021 and was in force until March 2022. The deputy auditor general was asked to explain why there wasn\'t a budget supplied on behalf of the CBSA. He was also asked why there was a governance structure that wasn\'t put in place.ArriveCAN has cost Canadians millions and millions of dollars while we\'re experiencing a cost of living crisis. CBSA has been forced, in some sense, to outsource, looking for the expertise they don\'t have. We\'ve seen multiple breaches of very, very basic levels of accounting and reporting. Basic levels of trust, I think, were breached here. I\'m nervous that this could be going on in other ministries or even continuing in your ministry if we don\'t continue to see some of these checks and balances properly addressed and fully implemented.Mr. Blake Desjarlais: At what point do officials such as you and others who are involved directly in ArriveCAN, actually say that this is unreasonable? Canadians can\'t expect this, the non-competitive contracts and contracts that have no task authorizations. There are instances where we don\'t even have information as to the contractors or how much they charged.

(337,451453793663980507,'I would rather be in a place where employees disclose anything that might be an issue and give an independent person a chance to decide whether it\'s a conflict or not. It\'s clear that the people who did the actual work are not the two owners of GC Strategies. Some people do not want to respond to government calls for tender. They prefer to use a company like GC Strategies to go through the process. There are people who prefer to work on contract rather than as employees. I agree with the fact that there is better value when we do not use subcontractors.Mr. David Yeo was a contractor with Dalian Enterprises and had been awarded several contracts by National Defence and other departments. He was hired as an indeterminate public service employee at National Defence as an IT-03 on September 19, 2023. In his signed letter of offer, Mr. Yeo accepted the position and all terms and conditions of employment, including the need to declare any conflict of interest within 60 days. On February 28, when we learned of Mr Yeo\'s involvement with. Dalian and that he was also a member of our defence team, we immediately launched an internal. investigation into the hiring process and placed him on suspension with pay that same day. On March 14, the chief of the defence staff and I notified all internal leadership that PSPC had suspended the security clearances of certain companies, including Dalian.I don\'t have an issue with public servants doing other work on the weekends or in the evening, on their own time, if it\'s properly declared and assessed by an independent person. The key is to make sure their interests are declared. He was a specialist in bridging information flow between networks of different security classifications. The team he worked for quite wisely recognized that this was a skill set we needed going forward and that it would be more economical to turn him into an employee rather than pay the higher rate for a contractor.Mr. Chair, body shops exist with private sector clients as well, but they are certainly widely used in the public service. Body shops have, in effect, become the easy button when there\'s a short-term need for a skill set. There\'s value there for IT contractors who don\'t want to go through that bureaucracy. It\'s a condition of employment to actually disclose conflicts of interest. He agreed with this when he signed his letter of offer. He did not declare anything at the point of hiring or within the 60-day time frame.PSPC: National Defence spends roughly $5 billion on contracts. A small subset of that, but still a significant amount of money, is on professional services related to IT contracts. PSPC: I\'m quite satisfied that individuals who actually do the work, who come on site for National Defence or work remotely, have the proper security clearance. PSPC: If there is information that needs to be investigated, it may come directly to us through the provost marshal or it could be through the RCMP.Mr. Yeo applied and was added to a pool of IT professionals. He did not declare any conflicts at that stage, but we will look into that process with the help of the Public Service Commission. For the contracts that were through Dalian, we also want to make sure that we received the services that were contracted for, and to date the answer is yes, we did receive those services. We will also look at hiring practices within that broader unit to makesure that there is nothing untoward there.Yeo was at the bottom of the org chart. He probably was supervising a few contractors, but it was a low-level position. If he truly was making the amount of money through his business dealings that we now think he was, it is hard to comprehend how that math works for him as an employee, unless he was able to do his other business at night and on weekends and this just offered some steady income. The math is questionable, for sure. There were no public servants reporting to him in that job.The Department of National Defence was not involved with the ArriveCAN app. I believe that we are dealing with a small percentage of public servants, and I don\'t want to paint them all with the same brush. I am more preoccupied with ensuring that all employees who have other activities properly disclose them and have them validated by an independent person in terms of conflict of interest. There are 50 members, civilian and military, that actually has outside work that is possibly related to the Government of Canada.Mr. Yeo was still on probation when we found out, a few weeks back, that he had other business activities. As soon as we became aware of those, we suspended him with pay that same day. We are looking into whether the reference check was properly done. We\'re also confirming whether, on any of the contracted work to Dalian, the goods and services were indeed received. So far, the answer is yes, they were. We want to make sure we properly understand any business relationships between Dalian and other companies. It is entirely possible that Dalian was getting contracts through National Defence.I\'m struggling, Mr. Chair, to figure out the relevance here. We know Mr. Yeo. I am more concerned about his lack of disclosure of a conflict of interest. He did refer to a statement that he said National Defence made about no conflict. We are not aware of the statement he was referring to. There is no such investigation yet, but I have committed to keeping the provost marshal informed of our work. If it gets to the point that he feels an investigation is warranted, he will let me know.Mr. Yeo\'s political affiliations while he was a contractor and that they predate joining the public service are not of import to us. His political activities, in terms of an election, predate his employment, so they are not a concern. Public Services and Procurement Canada maintains a regime where any contractors who have been behaving inappropriately are effectively barred from bidding on any government contracts. Dalian was on multiple supply arrangements and standing offers that I believe were all put in place.',110,'Mr. Bill Matthews'),

There\'s a $3-million difference, and it\'s a 60% delta.I did not inform anyone at the department that I signed anything. Then again, I did not actually sign it. I had a signature available for the staff at the office to use after the 19th. I did put in a no-access, no-contact, no non-disclosure with Dalian. I signed that on November 10, 2023, which was within the 60-day window. Due to the hype and everything else around this particular ArriveCAN app, I ended up having to put in my resignation.I\'m two gates deep in DND on a pretty much daily basis, helping them over there, getting the right capabilities into the right hands of the war fighters. I got right into this as quickly as I could in the fall, especially when Botler was making the waves they were, which I think was inappropriate. I hold and I did hold a higher than top secret security clearance for Dalian. As well, in my short time of 42 days with the department, I also had a top secret clearance there.I was not even aware that this smaller contract had even come through until I started reading into this file for our meetings. At that time I had my hands off the wheel of Dalian even before September 19 and that\'s why I provided my signature to the staff so if there was something going on, I would not even be aware of it.

The discussions about me moving over to the public service have been very recent. We didn\'t expect a conflict to happen at all, because of the level of position I went into at DND. It\'s a very low-level position. There was no conflict awareness at all. We were just putting in the safeguards to make sure that, if there ever were one in the future, they would be in place. It just could have been done on a more timely basis and prior to my joining on the 19th.IT professional consultants not employees were paid between $540 to $1,000 per day, depending on the service. \"We don\'t have enough trained, technical people coming out of the indigenous side of things,\" he says. \"There is no easy button when it comes to staffing all of the other aspects that go along with that, so absolutely, yes, I appreciate the backdrop\" \"I\'m looking for multiple sources of income, and I\'m sure many Canadians are in the same boat, whether they\'re working for the government or not\"Coradix CEO says he\'s known Colin Botler since he came to Coradix.

(364,451453793663980561,'Transport Canada has the opportunity now to fix that going forward. It will be years before projects are completed. So far only 30 out of the 181 that have been allocated funding have been completed. There will be about seven reports, if you look, between February, today and May. The commissioner of the environment and sustainable development in the past would issue throughout the year probably five or six reports. It\'s just about making sure that we are focusing on matters important to Canada and spreading them out.The House of Commons has released three new reports on programs supporting Canada\'s indigenous peoples. The first focused on housing in first nations communities. The second examined the design and implementation of the national trade corridors fund. The third looked at the first nations and Inuit policing program. The reports were tabled in the House of Parliament on Tuesday. The Commons is sitting on the traditional, unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people, which is also known as Ottawa. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here to discuss three reports that were just tabled.Audits of federal programs to support Canada\'s indigenous peoples reveal a pattern of failure. The lack of progress clearly demonstrates that the government\'s passive, siloed approach is ineffective. A fundamental shift is urgently needed to drive significant progress in providing proper support to indigenous families and communities across the country, especially those most in need, which currently are too often left behind. The federal government\'s approach is not aligned with delivering on its commitments to support the self determination of Canada’s indigenous peoples.The department and CMHC disagreed with us because they feel the program is one of applying for funding. It is our view that when you have a capacity issue and some communities are unable to apply, those that are likely in the greatest need aren\'t accessing the funding. The approach the government is using is passive and siloed, and it hasn\'t been working over the last two decades. It\'s time for a fundamental shift in how Indigenous Services Canada approaches these types of programs with communities if the goal is really to support them in self determination.Transport Canada used a lot of data over many sources and were well informed as they designed the calls. The RCMP wasn\'t tracking, and one of the main requirements of the agreement is to dedicate a police officer a hundred per cent of the time to a community. The approach of being passive and siloed and having communities apply doesn\'t appear to be working. Indigenous Services Canada and CMHC didn\'t have a plan on how to fund long-term housing projects, he says. \"I\'m rather discouraged that it\'s been 20 years and there is little progress despite the amount of money that has been invested\"In order to support reconciliation and self-determination, it\'s also about ensuring that communities create the knowledge, the capacity and the skills to take over some of the programs that are being offered by the federal government. Indigenous Services Canada\'s data shows the communities with the poorest needs getting less money. The focus was on giving funding to either shovel-ready or quick-to-complete projects, instead of really assessing the needs individually. It isn\'t an equitable allocation when you\'re not aware of the needs across all of the communities.',108,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),
(365,451453793663980563,'Auditor General: It does seem outrageous that when it comes to something as fundamental as a roof over one\'s head, we\'re using old data. Communities with the poorest housing conditions received less targeted funding than those with better housing, Auditor General says. Public Safety Canada could not provide documentation of a review in 2018 of 19 of RCMP expenditures to ensure that funds were used for the program, he says. \"It really surprises that the department claims to have conducted a review but has no documentation whatsoever\"',108,'Mr. John Nater'),

Report indicates that the percentage of homes in need of major repairs decreased from 20.8% to 19.7% , but the homes that needed to be replaced increased from 5.6% to 6.5%. This, to me, would indicate that there are more homes prohibitive to repair than there are those that need general repairs, which are, at least percentage-wise, receiving more repairs.',108,'Mr. Shaun Chen'),
(367,451453793663980567,'In Alberta, 28% of houses were in need of major repairs. In 2022-23, it received only $19 million.

If it had used more recent information, like the most recent census we just conducted, how much funding would the Alberta region be entitled to?. What do you think the impacts of not funding these projects are, from your discussions with the departments?The consequence of not having houses in northern Alberta and living outside in minus 50-degree weather is death. In just the city of Edmonton, over 3,000 were houseless, an increase that was larger than and paled in comparison to every year prior. If we can\'t help those who we\'ve come into treaty with, what kind of country is Canada? We are not honourable partners. We\'re failing, and we\'ve been failing for generations. It\'s clear.

We are focused on improving and further strengthening our processes, especially when it comes to IT procurement. New measures that we ve put in place have already addressed a number of these areas. We continue to take action to further strengthen the procurement of IT services.There was not a one-to-one relationship between the NSE and GC Strategies. The Public Health Agency, the CBSA and various departments came forward and said that because of the global pandemic, they had a need to move quickly. There was a whole series of steps, with a challenge function at the DG level within CBSA, to outline specifically what was required to move forward. The contracting authority pushed back several times, looking to ensure that the information was accurate and that it was really clear.There are two tools we use. One is a procurement stop-work order for 180 days. We have a second tool, which is a heavy hammer in terms of security. Both tools are in place, and right now we\'re working across the system to terminate contracts and there\'s no new work. The suspension is a prohibition until further notice. If there\'s more information forthcoming, if the RCMP. well, for all intents and purposes, it can\'t be in perpetuity without some type of recourse, so we consider them suspensions.Last year, Public Services and Procurement Canada fired five employees who did not comply with the policies requiring them to declare a conflict of interest. The onus is on both the public servant and the contractor to disclose any potential conflict. There are about 2,600 companies on that list in various commodity areas. The list is publicly available and all the companies are on it, but we\'re trying to work to provide the breakdown. Some of them are very large companies that are well known.In 2020, when the first contracts were being let, there was no mention of ArriveCAN.

Minister Duclos has been briefed by the Auditor General. We are looking at the whole issue and making sure that we have the direction set to move forward. It differed significantly and radically. We doubled the contract value we did in the year with the same amount of staff.The Government of Canada has different levers it can use for restitution.

It\'s safe to say that it could be as a result of the same model that arrive scam is being based upon. Would the possibility exist that what we see with arrive scam, a $60-million minimum, could be used for this largest project ever in the history of Canadian government in IT? Is that possible?

I support this motion to get those answers from the President of the Treasury Board.The $60 million that went to profits could have made a world of difference in my riding. It could have gone toward a harvesters support grant and funding for community food programs. I am asking you to explain to them why the government let some CEOs walk away with millions. There have been recommendations that must not have been implemented to allow for such drastic failures by this Liberal government on ArriveCAN. The Nutrition North program is a major failure. It\'s supposed to help poverty, but that it\'s contracted out is another indication of whether meeting indigenous peoples\' needs actually actually happens.',107,'Ms. Lori Idlout'),

I think it\'s very clear and particular in the context of what we heard yesterday, both at committee and through the media, that hearing from Minister Anand is of particular importance.Dalian\'s identity as an indigenous company as part of the set-aside for indigenous procurement is obviously absurd and a manipulation of the intention of the policy. Why is this practice of multi-level subcontracting so common that there are 635 different companies doing it? Why can\'t we just keep a registry of those capable of doing the work to perform specific tasks?I want to ask specifically about the Liberal Minister of Procurement, Jean-Yves Duclos. We just heard some questions about the role of the minister. We\'re supposed to have a system of ministerial accountability.Ms. Reza: I would expect that it\'s not just a one-way dialogue where you\'re telling the spokesman for the department what to say if it comes up in the House of Commons. The way this is being framed, including by Liberal members.is that the minister is just a sort of passive passenger, receiving briefings like students at a seminar listening to what they\'re being told by the experts and asking interesting questions along the way.

Obviously, when we see audit findings of this significance, we take them very seriously\"Accountability rests with various entities. We have a responsibility to set strict rules. We are now in the process of determining whether we need to augment or strengthen our policies and directives. Good controls will eventually uncover weaknesses, that is what good controls are about. I think we have a strong financial function within the federal government. Just look at the financial statements, which have been unqualified for 25 years. It\'s unfortunate that, in this case, controls don\'t seem to have been followed and well documented.I\'m extremely concerned by Mr. Richard\'s comments yesterday, to be fair.

There are mechanisms in place that are there to ensure that conflict doesn\'t exist, and it appears in this case, as reported by the Auditor General, that those measures may not have been followed.My request isn\'t just for the people responsible at the Canada Border Services Agency. I think the agency has been audited more than normal and it now needs a chance to put a plan in place.MI think I\'m being forthcoming in saying that absolutely there\'s a problem if. If there is a conflict of interest, no, it\'s not allowed. With GC Strategies, we had an audit on the contracts and we know what the outcomes were. I\'m not going to conclude without a wider review of all these contracts there have been no audits, at this point, on all those contracts themselves that every contract was done outside the rules because it was GC Strategies.

What things should we be recommending?Mr. Richard, thank you very much for your testimony and for all the work your members do every day to ensure that taxpayers get their money\'s worth. This is something that started under Mr. Harper and the Conservative government. It\'s this obsession with privatizing and outsourcing what are important public services to maintain and enhance.

On the face of this outrageous fleecing of taxpayers, did any frontline border officers get a performance bonus like management did?I\'m pleased to hear, Mr. Chair, that the NDP is in support not only of the motion, but of the amendment. It was rather disappointing last week that we had Mr. Weber here at committee, essentially doing what he\'s doing today.

All I can tell you is that basic fundamentals in accounting best practices were not respectedThe Association of Canadian Financial Officers represents accountants, comptrollers, auditors and other financial professionals. Dany Richard: I was severely disappointed with the findings and the implications for the integrity of internal controls and financial oversight within the federal public service during the pandemic. Richard: As financial professionals, we have the ethical obligation to speak up, but this obligation gets bypassed by hiring consultants to be yes-men for untold amounts. We shouldn\'t be contracting out work that can be performed by public servants at a much lower cost, all while reducing taxpayers confidence in how their tax dollars are being spent.When a member tells me they\'ve seen wrongdoing, I will tell them to raise it, document it and then let it go. I can\'t tell you one case I\'ve ever heard of that had a favourable outcome for a whistle-blower.

We just need to implement them,\" he adds. \"When you keep accurate records, those records remain there. We need more examples of people who did the right thing and it ended in a favourable situation\"Our members must be trusted and given a chance to show their expertise. Too often consultants are used automatically. It is insulting to our members to hear that there is a lack of knowledge within the public service, given that external consultants who are hired need to work with them to prepare their report. We need to ensure that whistle-blowers are protected. There was a clear lack of respect of the financial framework that\'s in place. Basic due diligence could easily be picked up and controls in place to prevent this from happening.Every public servant adheres to a code of conduct. For our members, however, for those who have certain designations, the bar is a bit higher. The challenge with this is that even though you haven\'t done anything wrong you\'re just doing your job there could be consequences to you personally. We tell our members to send an email raising their concerns and to document them. This way, at least the ball is in the employer\'s court and you are protected. In general, when internal controls are applied, there aren\'t any issues and nothing to report.There\'s nothing inherently wrong when it\'s done for the right reasons, but when it becomes the de facto practice, it is an issue. Based on the Auditor General\'s report, we can\'t even identify how much ArriveCAN actually cost. For my members, it\'s very frustrating, because if any one of them had been consulted, you could have just let us do our job. We don\'t need to reinvent the wheel. This is basic bookkeeping. It is easy to prevent these things.The Financial Administration Act was not followed. Someone has to be accountable for that. A whistle-blower needs to know that when they speak up, they will be protected. Our members, if they are positioned well in the front end, can prevent blunders from happening in the first place. The levels of productivity, I have no doubt, have increased, but there are intangibles that happen when you\'re working in the office. We want to be an ally. Just let us do our job.When it comes to finance, we must be consulted and listened to. Our members don\'t deal directly with procurement. They\'re not procurement officers. They make recommendations, but they don\'t act as police. Increasing the number of financial officers, of auditors, we have is a return on investment. It\'s not an expenditure, it\'s a returns on investment that\'s worth the investment. If my members detect any anomalies or anything that needs to be raised, they\'ll raise it.

He says his office is independent from other federal organizations, including Public Services and Procurement Canada. His office completed a review of 41 competitive and non-competitive procurement processes and resulting contracts, contract amendments and service orders, under which work was performed for the creation, implementation and maintenance of Arrive CAN. The review does not include subcontracts, as these are beyond the legal authorities of my position.A majority of files reviewed were for professional services contracts through which work was authorized under a TA. 20 of the 143 TAs reviewed did not include specific tasks, including descriptions of the activities to be performed. CBSA was responsible for the proactive publication or public disclosure of contract information on the Open Government website. Information was not proactively published for 17 of 41, or 41%, of contracts reviewed. There were no assessments for more than 30 resources named for ArriveCAN-related TAs. The structure of the evaluation criteria was heavily weighted towards the technical component.Report: 76% of the time workers who were identified in the proposal did not perform the work. \"We saw no correlation between the resource in the bid and the resources provided in the task authorization\" \"We didn\'t do a value-for-money analysis, but we did say that there was value lost with the way the procurement was structured\" \"It\'s a question of transparency to the supplier community to make sure people aren\'t wasting their time\" \"Every supplier that\'s embedded within a government department will have access to certain documentation\"The invocation of the emergency exception under the government contracting regulations was in fact justified. The way the supplier was ultimately selected is a question that I believe this committee has asked about. There was very little transparency associated with many of these procurement processes, and it\'s causing people to ask questions that will now go unanswered because there\'s no documentation demonstrating why decisions were taken.

The report is considered final, but there are ongoing discussions within the office on components of the report that we\'re still looking into, says the Auditor General\'s office. The findings are difficult to make when you don\'t have sufficient information to make a finding, he says.There is the secondary issue of the bait and switch review that we\'re also actively contemplating. The issue we had with the median bands was that a change was made with the formulation that originally or normally happens that\'s the median price plus 30% or minus 20% for acceptable financial offerings. There was a higher incentive for them to bid to low because it was less risky. The new directive makes clear, based on roles and responsibility, who has the obligations associated with documentation. It makes clear that the documentation obligation lies with the contracting authority. The previous member highlighted one of the recommendations with a real consequence, which is the authority for the CBSA to issue task authorizations.The median bands issue was meant to address this lowball issue. It was a valid attempt, I think. In execution, it certainly didn\'t play out as anticipated. As a result, it has had some unintended consequences, which we noted to be that in four instances, competitive-priced bids were given zero point allocations. If we find the baseline data to be any higher than 76%, then I will have a very different opinion on how significant this issue is. If this is an outlier and the baseline turns out to be much lower, it\'s indicative of something somewhat unique to ArriveCAN.There were inconsistencies in what CBSA and PSPC thought were best practices for the road forward on that specific contract. I think there are times when there are differences of opinion between the business owner and the contracting authority. In this circumstance, I think the appropriate recourse mechanism would have been through the Canadian International Trade Tribunal. I find it baffling that not a single one of those suppliers did so. I expect PSPC to catch and push back on these types of criteria in the future. I\'m sure the CBSA is not looking forward to our follow-up review because one of the things we will be looking at is specifically the recommendation about documentation.The number one issue if not 1(a), maybe 1(b) is documentation. This is a struggle across the federal government. The bait and switch issue is that 76% of the time, some or all of the named resources were switched out and did not deliver any services. There are rules preventing that from happening, absolutely. There is no level of coordination between departments for them to ultimately know if a supplier is working simultaneously among multiple departments. It\'s very important to be clear with suppliers what the true intentions of the contract are.',103,'Mr. Alexander Jeglic'),

We have already introduced several new control measures that start to address the observations of the Auditor General s report.

We are one point of advice. There are other factors that were likely considered. We, unfortunately, don\'t have the documentation to understand why the decision was ultimately made. We definitely need to ensure that we do have evidence and documentation that actual decisions are being made at the appropriate level. We need to build in a formal mechanism that has training, off-boarding and whatnot, so that while there\'s maybe engagement of external resources, we actually build up the internal capacity.The government is trying to bring more transparency to how the work is priced within these contracts. We\'re also expanding the use of our price verification tools, so that if we do have to do non-competitive contracts and there are legitimate cases set out in our policy, we have greater transparency and more recourse to price verification. Increased competition will be the most important factor in driving down prices and ensuring value for Canadians. We are also looking internally at training for all procurement officers to make sure they are more aware of the new requirements.There have been a lot of questions around GC Strategies. GC Strategies was pre-qualified on supply arrangements. They had previously bid on a number of different pieces of work with different departments across the government. We acknowledge that it was not proper practice to have task authorizations that were too general and did not specify clearly the activities that would be undertaken. We were not project management. We did not have an awareness of the overall project budget or of the totality of contracts. As a department, we were focused on what goods and services they needed.I don\'t think any of us has the certainty on where the cost of the ultimate work that was undertaken in relation to ArriveCAN is. It would be very difficult to say what is the precise portion of the expenditure that went just for app creation and development.

(479,451453793663980791,'The pressure to move quickly in the face of a global pandemic meant that insufficient attention was paid to the governance structure of this project. The requirements are in place as of now. We are going to be doing further review and training to make sure that, given the number of new staff that have joined the agency through the pandemic years, we have the same level of training and comfort with the directives. There have been no findings of wrongdoing in our investigations into Public Health Agency of Canada employees, and no employees have been suspended.The Public Health Agency of Canada welcomes the Auditor General\'s report on the development of the ArriveCAN application. The report outlines serious areas of concern in relation to the processes and controls around the application\'s development. There was no overall project established as should have been the case in IT projects. The findings point to the importance of formally documenting roles and responsibilities at the outset of a project, rather than at a later stage. We are strengthening our existing guidance and supporting tools, and putting in place training with respect to these file documentation requirements.The COVID Alert app was developed as a tool to help limit the spread of COVID-19. It was downloaded about 6.9 million times. More than 58,000 users entered keys into that app. The idea was that it would provide an extra tool to allow Canadians to identify when they might have been exposed to the virus. There was a very clear public health rationale for the need to move quickly in the development of the app. I can assure you that there was no contract between the Public Health Agency of Canada and GC Strategies.There was close collaboration between the Public Health Agency and the Canada Border Services Agency in the elaboration and development of ArriveCAN. There was no formal project governance put in place, and no documentation of those decisions, which the Auditor General has pointed out. We believe that is a best practice that should be put into place in all future crises, and we have taken steps to ensure that this is part of our standard operating procedure and protocols. The Prime Minister is not a signatory to these contracts. We found no evidence that agency employees or staff received an invitation from vendors. There are also conflict of interest declarations that can be filed.There were 83 different orders in council, to be specific. The CBSA stated in their testimony that in order to increase the speed by which the versions would be deployed they were not all tested. This was the first time in the agency\'s history that we had faced a global pandemic. Our processes and procedures have been continually evolving after every crisis, and this produced quite a number of lessons in terms of our governance and our documentation.I\'m going to turn it over to my colleague, Luc Brisebois, from the border services. We\'re obviously not comfortable when people are erroneously advised.The $59 million associated with the contract was related to the development of the app and its technology. The contract has a sole-source justification on file that identifies the expertise of the vendor in aerospace services and in administering public health and health projects at the municipal, provincial and local levels. There is no documentation of the initial contact with the company. The Public Health Agency of Canada was working to establish the public health measures, guidance and border operations that needed to be put in place with the corresponding policy, legal, privacy and other structures.The Public Health Agency did not contract with GC Strategies. It would have been CBSA that was monitoring those contracts related to the app development. There was a de facto management of the app going forward that was not defined. Both of the recommendations that were made by the procurement ombud will be completed by next month. We have taken steps to codify the IT project governance structure as part of our emergency preparedness planning. We will have oversight of all contracts. We renewed our training and checklists for contracting.',101,'Ms. Heather Jeffrey'),

I think it\'s unfortunate that the Auditor General had to recommend such basic levels of qualification for good governance.Auditor General: ArriveCAN is a failure on three fronts. It failed to deliver good management, deliver the best value for Canadian taxpayers\' dollars, and failed to address the critical underfunding of the public service. The Public Health Agency and the Canada Border Services Agency undertook a process of jointly finding ways to develop this app. They failed to actually come to an agreement on governance, an. agreement on budget, an agreement as to, ultimately, who was going to be. overseeing and operating this project.I support this motion because of the intent to get to the bottom of how these individuals at GC Strategies were able to take advantage of our public service, not just once but several times. It is true that there is a rot in the public service. That rot\'s been generational and I\'ve been clear about that generational rot. I welcome the Liberals\' motion towards transparency.

The decision as to whether an action was of a criminal nature to the authority on that, which is the RCMP. It is very unclear who the individual is speaking to. It appears to be a briefing note for a committee appearance. I have heard no testimony around it. It remains that whoever decided to award a certain contract needs to be properly documented.Audit looked at how the Canada Border Services Agency, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada managed the procurement and development of the application. The audit showed a glaring disregard for basic management and contracting practices throughout ArriveCAN\'s development and implementation. The lack of information to support Arrive CAN spending and decisions has compromised accountability, says the auditor general. The report was tabled in the House of Commons yesterday and will be discussed by the committee on Monday. The committee will then hold a hearing on the report on Tuesday.We did audit the use of ArriveCAN in 2021, when we were looking at border measures. We did highlight there that it improved the measures at the border, but we did not actually look at the application until we issued this report yesterday. We interviewed managers who no longer work at the agency but are still part of the public service. We didn\'t see any evidence that employees who were invited to events reported it to their supervisors. There was no documented evidence. I would have expected to see that.

We\'ve put some things in place, some belt and suspenders in certain cases that I hope one day will no longer be needed. We are troubled by this, but I would hate for that to get extended to the people who are doing critical activities across the organization.CBSA\'s management response to both of these reports reflects the work we have already done and will be doing to make sure that all our procurement actions are aligned with policies and processes.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.I\'m working on cleaning things up, but clearly, according to the two ministers I report to. If there is wrongdoing, it needs to be found out. We have an internal investigation going on. As I said, the documentation was not good. The inability to answer the question as to who picked that company has been hanging over the agency for over a year now. There\'s been testimony that there was pressure and other people took decisions. I\'m open to having that play out. I have not seen any evidence to that, so all we have to go on right now is the paper.I launched an internal investigation, and the investigators provided that information to the RCMP. I can tell you that under my leadership, CBSA will not disregard PSPC\'s advice and concerns. Why that may have happened, I don\'t know. In any given year, dozens of misconduct allegations are investigated. Many of those are founded and discipline is taken. I am not stepping in front of it and I\'m not carrying out my own investigation. I\'m relying on my security team and investigators to follow up on these issues.I share your disappointment that there is such a lack of documentation. We have made some significant changes.

I will continue to take action, and the Auditor General and the procurement ombud have put a finer point on that. We will be transparent in the actions we\'re taking. We\'re committed to implementing all of this in this calendar year. I have told him of my plans to fix it.

Some of these issues involving direct conflicts of interest were not reported to CBSA.Auditor General: The rot at the core of the system is that we so dramatically underfunded our civil service that we are now forced into a dependency situation where we are vulnerable to companies like GC Strategies, which used an opportunity to take more and more. There\'s a massive failure of our public service to report and to be agile enough to make sure there is enough reporting to make the picture we\'re talking about today far clearer.

There was very little documentation as to why GC Strategies was selected and how they could fulfill the requirements of the contract. There were so many key elements that I would have expected to see documented that just aren\'t there, and when you don\'t have the records, many of the questions you\'re asking just can\'t be answered.The audit of the ArriveCAN application looked at how the Canada Border Services Agency, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Public Services and Procurement Canada managed the procurement and development of the application. The audit found disappointing failures and omissions everywhere we looked. The fact that the CanadaBorder Services Agency did not have complete and accurate financial records was the most concerning of our findings. We concluded that the public service did not ensure that Canada received the best value for money. I would tell you that we paid too much for this application. We estimated that it cost around $59.5 million.The government spent too much money for the ArriveCan app, says the auditor general. The record keeping is among the worst I have seen in several years, he says. The important decisions, the basic decisions, were not well documented in the contracting file, he adds. The agency\'s head made an assessment that they did not have the skills or the capacity to deliver the app, the auditor says. \"I would have, however, expected to see less of a long-term dependency on external resources as time went on,\" the auditor adds.We might expect that the requirements relating to the skills of the resources selected for a contract would be clear and exhaustive. We often found that these requirements were not clear, either in the job descriptions or in the contracts. No evaluation of the individual\'s skills is done when the non-competitive contracts are awarded. A mix of lesser, more experience and 10 years or more would have resulted in better value for money. It was reasonable, in our view, at the start of the pandemic, to seek help outside the public service.The government has paid too much for the ArriveCAN app, says the report\'s author. There was some value to the app during the pandemic, but the best value for money was not achieved, he says. The public service should do better, going forward, on projects like this, he adds. The government was effective at delivering on this app, but it was done very quickly quicker than you would see most things, says Mr. Boudreau. It\'s probably some of the worst record-keeping I have seen in a long time, he writes.I believe that the public service was trying to act quickly in an emergency. I do not believe that an emergency is an excuse for throwing the rules out of the window. The requirements that were used were so restrictive that the only vendor that responded to the request for proposals was GC Strategies.

That would be what an institution would need to demonstrate in order to have access to the program.Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada recognizes that modernizing and strengthening elements of our immigration system is necessary to address the challenges associated with welcoming more people. This year Canada has already welcomed approximately 405,000 permanent residents as of October 31, 2023, up from about 388,000 during that same period in 2022. Since the audit period, IRCC has made significant progress in reducing processing times and application backlogs. We continue to work toward our goal of reducing overall backlogs and processing 80% of new applications within service standards, accounting for expected delays in complex cases.I think what I have found in my role in this department is that there are times when a file has been sitting for a long time and it gets to my attention either because of direct client outreach or because the issue is raised by a member of Parliament. At times it\'s also because we notice that there could be a missing document. There could be an abandoned file or a security check that\'s not complete. It creates a lot more stress in the system overall. How we\'ve attempted to address that is obviously by trying to improve the client centre, and the call centre experience.I think we have to utilize the technology. For instance, in the call centre, we\'ve adopted robotic processing so that the triaging of documents coming in is not done manually. I think we need to do a better job of reporting, and we hope that by using automation to triage the processing, we make it easier for officers to review the files they are reviewing. All people benefit from automation, not just those who fall into the automation categories. The resource allocation distribution that we can do is a benefit for all clients. We just need to demonstrate that clearly.Asylum-seekers now arrive at more official points of entry. We establish an arrival management plan every weekend and evening, especially in the winter months. We\'re trying various approaches because the number of arrivals to date is really the highest in the country. I\'ve worked very closely with churches in the Toronto area, where there was considerable pressure to move these people, with the help of volunteers, from the churches and shelters to federal government hotels. For the privately sponsored refugees, I completely acknowledge that right now the wait time is very high.There has been an enormous increase in the number of foreign students. We\'ve made some significant changes to the study permit system. We acknowledge that there is systemic racism within the department. I think there is a huge benefit to global processing. We are looking to increase about 20 Canadian-based staff on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa. We\'re trying to have a bit of more migration diplomacy, more sensitivity to the issues that someone in another location may face and how we try to address the situation.I\'d have to check which of our service fees have a reimbursement attached to them. We have more staff and more funding to deliver on a broader program and a greater program. We work very closely with the UNHCR and with the International Organization for Migration. We\'re trying to expand our partnerships to get to people who are sometimes harder to reach. I think a combination of two things will help us address some of the recommendations from the Auditor General. It probably would have taken longer if it had been done outside the COVID period.There\'s a lot of work we can do to improve our systems, and we have investments to do that. I think it\'s about stabilizing the growth of FTEs and looking at how modernization can deal with the surge in volumes. I\'m hoping that through the benefits of some of our modernization investments, we can stabilize the organization so that we can leverage those technologies rather than hire more people. The fraud rate, which is very high, isn\'t specific to the continent; fraud occurs in other parts of the world. We need to be better positioned to predict and analyze to have better sight on different crises.I think the best way to answer your question is by looking at how we can provide, when a client is interested, pathways to move from temporary foreign worker to more permanent residency in Canada. The recognized employer pilot is very helpful in working with employers and also in supporting those who come on a temporary basis. There was a decision around prioritizing the arrival of Ukrainians. We need to take a look at that and try to expand it as much as we can, and even look at our asylum population.The increase is mainly related to modernization efforts. We\'ve reached the francophone immigration target a year earlier than anticipated. We need to promote and recruit in a more targeted manner in order to attract people wishing to come to Canada. I was surprised to see just how quickly over to the U.S. their system continues to be. Australia, Australia did a review of their immigration system, and they mentioned Canada 42 times, so I think Canada is key in terms of looking at that work.',89,'Ms. Christiane Fox'),

Let\'s not forget that, indeed, Stephen Harper refused to meet with first nations leaders on a regular basis. Our Prime Minister, as you know, commits to meeting with all of the distinctions-based groups at the national level and at the regional level very frequently. There are formalized mechanisms of meeting with indigenous peoples and leaders across this country. Those exist because of the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party.In November 2015, there were 105 long-term drinking water advisories in over 67 first nations communities. Today, 96% of all first nations peoples have access to clean water. On education, for generations indigenous peoples have been forced to conform to western colonial metrics of success that don\'t reflect their own values. The Government of Canada indeed used education as a spearhead to suppress and control, with the ultimate goal of killing the Indian in the child. Following the lead of indigenous partners, we\'re working hard to close gaps in education.MP Vidal: There\'s still a long way to go to address the inequalities facing first nations communities. Indigenous Services Canada introduced new metrics this year that reflect calls by first nations to move away from western expectations of on-time graduation and toward first nations-defined student outcomes. MP Bradford: I would say, yes, the progress needs to be maintained with a government that understands the importance of equity for first nations community functioning, maintaining the co-development of first nations drinking water legislation, and continuing to support first nations access to clean water.I think your list of Auditor General\'s reports that speak to the ongoing challenge of indigenous people in a systemically oppressive colonizing system is a fair question. What I would say is that, under our federal government, we have put reconciliation at the core under the federal Liberal government. There has been an increase in indigenous spending by 168% since 2015. Is it enough to close the gap? I fundamentally think that it is not. We know what the gap is in housing and in infrastructure, for example, and many other spaces.Treaty 8 chiefs have often given me the history lessons that I need to understand. Never in the history of this country has a law been developed with indigenous peoples. I hold the officials accountable every single day and I do it through honest, open communication and collaboration.

The reality is that graduation rates, under this department, have declined from 41% in 2017-18 to 34% in 2021-22. The target that has been set going forward is 26%.

I think we\'re committed to working with first nations based on the resources available to the department, in order to build the best infrastructure at the best place and in the best time.I think there are three foundational factors that lead to conditions where there may be unsafe drinking water. Infrastructure and infrastructure investments are a huge part of the investments that have been made since 2015. The Atlantic First Nations Water Authority has been designed and controlled by first nations over the last 10 years.

(623,451453793663981079,'I can speak to what we saw, and then invite Mr. Hupp , if he would like, to add to it. The Canada Revenue Agency highlighted that it looked at 53% of the businesses we identified as being potentially ineligible for the wage subsidy through either pre or post-payment work. In my opinion, the only way you can determine if a business is eligible is to do post- payment work. I stand by my recommendation that much more rigour and more work are needed when it comes to examining the eligibility of businesses.Auditor general: The financial statements are an important source of information for the use of Parliament and Canadians to hold the government accountable for its management of public funds. The auditor\'s report starts on page 56 of volume 1 of the Public Accounts of Canada 2023. We found the financial statements to be credible and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the public sector. This year\'s commentary draws attention again to a significant uncertainty about the continued operations of the Trans Mountain Corporation. The audit noted that some federal organizations relied on poor or incomplete data to calculate the retirement costs of assets.I\'m very concerned about the fact that the government is adopting a standardized approach, as it usually does, to deal with a situation that is anything but standard. It has to do a lot more work on post-payment verifications to determine whether the amounts were paid to ineligible businesses or taxpayers. It\'s a great question to ask the RCMP, what they do when something is lost, stolen or damaged and how they dispose of it. We would care that they have properly recorded that the Crown asset no longer exists and that it\'s been removed from the books.There are 7,500 IT systems out there that are considered in need of being modernized or wound down. The audit here was really to follow up on previous findings from an audit and on statements that the government made many decades ago that they knew aging IT was a concern. The financial transactions could be accurate. It doesn\'t mean a value-for-money audit was done. It was about whether or not they were accurately portrayed in their financial statement. We would not make recommendations about how a Crown corporation should spend its funding.The report that the Canada Revenue Agency recently released, following up on some of its postpayment work, was potentially misleading for a reader. This was a new auditing standard that was required for all listed entities. The key audit matters in our audit report are just to show you where we focus our efforts and what are the most significant to our audit. We highlighted some areas where we\'re seeing that Crown corporations, for example, this year large ones are starting to report on how they managed risks related to climate. Do I think the government has an opportunity to be a leader in this space? Absolutely.',86,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

We didn\'t get any qualification as a result of the implementation, to be fair, but I also recognize that a lot more work still needs to be done.Mr. Chair, the government is committed to being open, transparent and accountable to Canadians and parliamentarians. The public accounts include the government\'s audited consolidated financial statements and other detailed financial information for the fiscal year ending March 31. For the Public Accounts of Canada 2023, which were recently tabled, the Auditor General issued an unmodified or clean audit opinion. This is the 25th year in a row that we have received such an opinion, which means that the financial statements were presented faithfully in accordance with accounting principles.The amount of the lapse in the last fiscal year was $54.2 billion. Out of the total amount, that represents about $3 billion that is internal. It includes things like some of the IT services received by SSC. It also includes legal services obtained from the Department of Justice, because we do have internal professional services also. There are requirements that have been there since 1950, for example. Are there a duplication of some information that already appears under departmental websites? I owe you an answer to that by December 31.Roch Hupp: Every lapse of every department should be unbundled to look at what the reason is. One reason is the timing of the payment for one of the key indigenous settlements that happened with the department of ISC. As these cases work through the system, we start to have more capacity to estimate them, but there are a lot of cases where we can\'t estimate the amount. He says the exposure is greater than simply what you see as a contingent liability number because we have many cases on the go.',86,'Mr. Roch Hupp'),

Welcome back to Finance. I\'ve heard from many people how lucky we are to have you back in Finance. From what I can read, it looks like the Bank of Canada lost $3.4 billion last year. I noticed on June 30 that they were up to three and a half billion already. So we lose money on pipelines. We lose money running a bank. Maybe we should get Loblaws to run it for us and they can actually provide a profit. It\'s remarkable.

Ms. Sinclair-Desgagn: Do you know whether we\'re exposed to a larger potential writeoff from any extensions or changes that the government has made to the CEBA loan repayment?

The total pollution price proceeds we recorded were a little over $8 billion, of which $7.75 billion was from the fuel charge. We paid out just a little under $7 billion in total.

We link the pollution pricing or fuel charge revenues to the climate action incentive payments. I would have to confirm what exactly is callable in the short term.

The NCC had done an assessment prior to going down the road of engaging a construction manager to ensure that it was cost-effective and it was the right course of action. The board of directors that makes the decisions. The Prime Minister had no involvement. We still have a deferred asset maintenance deficit. Is that an unfunded liability? To a certain extent, yes.That\'s correct. We do not have the legislative capacity to take on debt.The building and grounds of Rideau Hall, comprising 26 historic buildings and 79 acres of property, have been managed by the NCC since 1988. In 2013, it became clear that four buildings used to service, maintain and store equipment used to manage the 79 acre site and other official residences had reached the end of their useful life. We therefore began planning to replace them. The project would include selective demolition of the buildings, remediation of the contaminated soil, and the construction of one energy-efficient and modernized building that could serve as a service, maintenance and storage facility while also accommodating the 20 to 40 year-round and seasonal employees.Mr. Chair, I would start by saying that $8 million is a lot of money. The NCC takes the stewardship of all its public funds very, very seriously. The total project budget did include the cost of demolition of the four buildings and decontamination of the soils underneath them. There have been no employees who have lost their employment at the NCC. The building houses between 20 and 40 full-time and part-time staff. Think of groundskeepers. It\'s the touchdown workstation.Mr. Chair, I think it\'s useful to note that when the decision was made in 2018 to go with a construction manager, that followed two really salient points. A special examination by the Office of the Auditor General in 2017 concluded that we didn\'t have sufficient funds to look after the assets for which we had responsibility. As a result, we were given an additional $55 million in 2018 as part of our 2018 budget. Having determined how best to execute those additional funds and what model of construction should be considered, we decided to go to a construction management contract.The building that is most in need of deferred maintenance is 24 Sussex, the official residence of the Prime Minister. We have a list of worst to best, and we categorize them through an asset-condition report that we updated in 2021. We\'ve developed processes and methodologies to do the best we can with the funds that we have to address the deferred maintenance, as I said, in the order of priority that makes the most economic sense.

It seems like we are telling people to do things, but we are finding that long-standing challenges that we previously identified continue to hinder the full implementation. The Gender Results Framework lacked disaggregated data to monitor progress in advancing gender equality . There has been no framework for disability. These are things that are extremely important for those who are most vulnerable.',83,'Mrs. Karen Vecchio'),

It consists of six essential elements. There was a survey, which was forwarded to us by WAGE.

In your opinion, what are the causes of these problems?Had these problems already been raised during your previous audit, the one done in 2015?.

You know this, and please pass on to the Auditor General that we are always happy to receive you here.The Committee is meeting today for its study on Sustainable Development Technology Canada. Deputy auditor general Mr. Andrew Hayes is the witness. Mr. Hayes, I want to thank you for appearing here today. We know the rules in that you don\'t release any results until the report is tabled to Parliament. In fact, if you were to do that today, you would probably be offside because Parliament is supreme. I call this meeting to order. The member\'s time is up. Ms. Khalid: Can I have one last question, Chair?',82,'The Chair'),
(664,451453793663981161,'From here onwards, it will look like any other audit for Parliament and the committee. If we have any problems, as always, we will report it to Parliament. The decision we took to launch this audit was one we made on the basis of our independence. We take great care to preserve the identity of the people and companies we audit. In our reports, it is sometimes necessary to identify individuals or companies, but the decision to do so is carefully considered. It\'s not a decision we make without considering all the relevant factors.I would like to acknowledge that this hearing is taking place on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people. As we have just begun the audit, we have yet to finalize its scope. We are hoping to present our report to Parliament in 2024 before the summer recess. The allegations that we have received.... We have to recognize that SDTC, the foundation, is more arm\'s length than the normal department that we audit. We have a mandate to follow funding agreements, and that\'s what SDTC has with the federal government.The audit will look at beneficiary eligibility, overpayments and possibly conflicts of interest. The audit team has entered into discussions with the foundation and I know they\'ve already received some information. I don\'t know yet whether we\'ll be able to look at human resources issues. I have no complaints about our exchanges with the department or the information they provide. I\'ve been happy with the information that we\'ve been receiving. It\'s possible that we\'ll provide a total amount and make recommendations, but at this time it\'s impossible for me to say.The funding agreement becomes the centrepiece of our mandate. With a foundation that receives money like this from the government, it\'s structured in a very different way from, say, a department or a Crown corporation. We are aware that the human resources allegations that have been made by maybe current and former employees I\'m not entirely sure are a major concern for many people. We very well might ask every question we want and see what happens. However, we have to respect our mandate, that\'s clear.Auditor General says she doesn\'t know how many people contacted her office. She hopes to have the final report to Parliament before the summer recess. The audit process will be exactly the same as in other performance audits, she says. The Auditor General Act gives her the authority to inform public officials about matters discovered in her audit. The report will be available to the public in 2017, but the scope of the audit is still to be determined, the auditor says.\"We are not in the business of determining mens rea. The guilty mind is not our area of expertise. We gather facts,\" she adds.Sustainable Development Technology Canada is a foundation at arm\'s length. The minister considered other options another audit but we\'re getting in there, as well. The importance here is transparency and public trust. We will talk about the accountability relationship for this organization when we present our report. We get allegations like this. We look at them carefully. Sometimes the departments have taken action already. Sometimes they\'re just control problems, sometimes they\'re approval problems. In this case, with RCGT preparing a report.... Questions were left with that report.The importance of whistle-blowers and their ability to speak freely without fear of reprisal is fundamental. We\'re always confident with our reports and our findings. We are very careful. The biggest constraint that I\'m worried about is the scope of the funding agreement and the limits we might have. I don\'t think there are going to be any real constraints for us in this, apart from the human resources side, but we still have to determine that. It comes down to the level of control that the government has.',82,'Mr. Andrew Hayes'),

Do you know on which date PCO raised the issue, which was referred to PCO by you, with ISED?Okay. Who is in charge of governance at Sustainable Development Technology Canada? Will the CEO be who your office will primarily be working with?Auditor General: Why wasn\'t an audit initiated when this was first brought to your attention? It\'s since been evident that gross mismanagement has occurred at Sustainable Development Technology Canada. I want to be clear that in this billion-dollar Liberal slush fund, $40 million was reviewed by RCGT, and it didn\'t provide the fund with a clean bill of health. I\'d like to share some of my time with Mr. Brock in just a moment, but in light of the amount of funds that are available and the impropriety the misconduct allegations that have been raised, I\'m going to turn my time over to the Chair.',82,'Mr. Michael Barrett'),
(666,451453793663981165,'MPs from all parties asked questions about the Auditor General\'s office. Mr. Hayes said the audit was independent of any request from Parliament. He said the office consults with the Ethics Commissioner and the Department of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development. MPs also asked about the confidentiality of the people involved in the audit, and whether it would interfere with their work. The committee is expected to hold further hearings on the matter in the coming weeks. The audit report will be tabled at the next meeting of the House of Commons.',82,'Mrs. Brenda Shanahan'),

We don\'t have access to the kind of detailed information that departments are required to provide. In this case, I can see that there was a problem, which could likely have been avoided if Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada had managed the money itself.The Standing Committee on Public Accounts asked questions to the Office of the Auditor General. The committee wants to know why the $400 million fund for Sustainable Development Technology Canada hasn\'t been put to good use. MPs also want to know if the government is granting large sums to Crown corporations or third-party entities such as not-for-profits to carry out its political programs.

Why is it that HR issues can\'t be seen or reviewed by your office?.I want to thank Mr. Hayes for being present here. I think it\'s a critical issue that we\'re seeing and not just, I think, in this instance. We\'ve seen a troubling pattern in Canadian governments, with both this government and the previous government, of these issues of conflicts of interest arising. Bad governance can translate into things like breaches of the conflict of interest policies, which is probably the most severe and one of the largest ethical breaches that can be made when governments are entrusted with public funds.

I would note that at the time SDTC had rigorous and objective processes in place to assess, approve, and monitor projects. Since that audit, Liberal industry minister Navdeep Bains, as he was then, appointed a personal friend of Justin Trudeau\'s as chair ofSDTC.

(675,451453793663981183,'I don\'t know the reasons why the National Capital Commission decided to suspend or delay the project. I know that, in certain situations, the buildings are in such a state that it\'s hard or dangerous to try to keep them intact and usable. In this case, for operational and safety reasons, it\'s possible that they have to be demolished to make way for the construction of a new building, even though they\'re part of a complex considered as being of heritage importance. We have mechanisms in place, particularly on our real property side, in terms of project management.The National Capital Commission is a crown corporation whose mandate is set forth in its enabling statute, the National Capital Act. Under that act, the commission has a separate legal identity and its own control and accountability frameworks. Public Services and Procurement Canada is responsible for ensuring that the government has an overall strategic direction, which consists of examining new potential activities and guiding their development. The NCC\'s corporate plan would include the overall plan, with the NCC responsible for implementing day-to-day project management under its own authorities.As a Crown corporation, the organization doesn\'t have the obligation to report to PSPC. As an arm\'s-length organization, they actually don\'t require the department\'s approval to be able to move forward. The new building is considered a green building and has zero carbon emissions associated with it. In terms of the actual requirements and what they\'re actually using the building for, the National Capital Commission would be. able to provide a more specific response to this specific question. Depending on the offset of greener facilities on a go-forward basis, it may not be that much more expensive, again, in this case.The National Capital Commission\'s submitted master plans essentially provide the overall budget, divided into capital and operating budgets. The capital budget includes activities that enable us to undertake works for the construction, renovation and modernization of buildings under the NCC\'s responsibility. In the master plans, however, those works are treated as capital expenditures and considered from an overall perspective.

These unique mandates require a certain amount of flexibility in terms of their administration and management. For example, there are a number of Crown corporations that operate in a competitive environment, where there are certain sensitivities about what they can reveal and report. As a Crown corporation, they are not subject to that particular directive. But as a best practice, we do encourage Crown corporations to adopt their own policies and procedures.Parliament set out the governance framework for Crown corporations in the Financial Administration Act, part X. The board of directors is responsible for the oversight of a Crown corporation\'s business activities, to act in the best interest of the corporation and to exercise due care and diligence. Crown corporations are accountable to Parliament through the board of Directors and the responsible minister and report their plans and results to Parliament regularly. Treasury Board\'s primary responsibility with respect to Crown corporation governance is the approval of corporate plans and operating and capital budgets.',81,'Mr. Brian Gear'),

I have one of those. It\'s not heated. It doesn\'t have Internet capabilities. It does have electricity. You can turn a light on in there. Did anyone ever stop to think that was too much money?Can you explain why $5,870 was spent on fibre optic cabling for the $8-million barn project? We know it\'s one storey, and it\'s fully equipped with fibre optics. Why does it need the fibre optics to store vehicles and tools? Can you explain the marketing and communications firm, and why it was engaged for nearly $6,000 on the $ 8-million storage barn? Are you here to answer questions or to deflect? Which one?

That, in itself, is something that I\'d like to focus on, and how we can understand the processes of accountability and transparency that are already within the NCC.

The project is so complex that decisions have to be made in a timely manner, even though there are so many partners involved within Parliament, the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau and a Crown corporation.Audit looked at whether Public Services and Procurement Canada effectively managed the scope, schedule and cost during the early phases of the rehabilitation program. Based on a 2021 estimate, the cost of rehabilitating Parliament\'s Centre Block and of building the new Parliament Welcome Centre is expected to be between $4.5 and $5 billion.

We\'re sticking to the timelines that we anticipated for completion, as well as the budget range, which was noted by the AG. We heard Mr. Wright talk about doors earlier. Doors are often an area of heritage value.The restoration and modernization of Centre Block is the largest and most complex heritage rehabilitation project ever undertaken in Canada. Public Services and Procurement Canada is carrying out the work on the iconic Centre Block and the broader parliamentary precinct hand in hand with Parliament. The Auditor General recognized our use of flexible management approaches and reported that the department has effectively managed the scope, schedule and costs of the rehabilitation work. The department agrees with these recommendations and we are positioned to take action on all three within this calendar year.I\'ll start with the move-in date, and then move the technical budget question to Rob. First off, we are still on track for 2031 for the construction to be completed. There will be up to a year for user testing, commissioning of the building and ensuring that we have all the pieces working correctly. The budget element is still between $4.5 billion and $5 billion.

We are getting close to the completion of the interior demolition and abatement, which has entailed the removal of about 25 million pounds of asbestos.Lessons learned are really at the core of the methodology that we undertake within the precinct and the broader department. For Centre Block and the Parliament welcome centre, we did the most exhaustive assessment or investigation program that we\'ve ever undertaken. The biggest surprise, which we found quite early on in the project, was that the foundation of the east side of Centre Block, the Senate side, was not a modern foundation. We\'ll be engaging Parliament, hopefully soon, on determining design mock-ups for offices for parliamentarians and for the seating in the House chamber.There is a very strong framework around security clearances for all workers who come on to the site.

It\'s not as simple as buying something off the shelf and putting it into place. It means that you need to have a good plan and prudent management of funds. They have to come hand in hand with knowing where you\'re going, but also managing the costs associated with them. It shouldn\'t be rushed. You have to consider the privacy and security of information.I\'m pleased to be here today to discuss the reports that were just tabled in the House of Commons. We also included copies of special examinations of the Royal Canadian Mint, the Canadian Museum of History and the Laurentian Pilotage Authority. These three reports were made public by the Crown corporations earlier this year. There are two points that stood out to me from all of these performance audits. Weak or underused data often affects departments\' and agencies\' ability to make well-informed decisions.Audit: Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada did not meet its service standards for prompt processing in any of the eight programs we examined. People applying to refugee programs waited the longest on average, close to three years. At the end of 2022, 99,000 refugees were still waiting for decisions on their applications, and in the current processing environment, many will be waiting years. All six organizations we audited had action plans to address equity, diversity and inclusion, but none measured, or comprehensively reported on, progress against outcomes.The government has not acted on things that it knew following H1N1 and SARS. No funding had been dedicated to improving data on antimicrobial resistance. Canada has access to only two of 13 new antibiotics of last resort. Other countries have access to between eight and 13 of those new antibiotics. The federal government can help improve access to new antibiotics, but we found that it does very little to make them more accessible in Canada. The action plan is missing concrete measures, I doubt it will lead to concrete changes.There are 7,500 applications in that system and, as you rightfully said, 562 were deemed critical. The government-wide survey of chief information officers revealed that their ability to modernize their systems is hindered by the lack of funding to really support IT modernization. With systems that aren\'t modernized, there is a risk that the government doesn\'t appreciate the tremendous amount of time and money that is being put into stabilizing the system. The systems are between 20 and 60 years old. It\'s like an old car. You can drive it but it\'s not always reliable.Audit of public service should serve as an alarm bell to everyone across the public service, he says. Decades of chronic underfunding has brought the government to such a place, he adds. There needs to be better information around exactly how many systems need to be modernized and how many are not needed anymore, he writes. The government has taken external advice now and they\'re looking at this, but they don\'t have a full picture of how much it will cost, he argues.',78,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

(731,451453793663981295,'There are various mechanisms built into the way in which the program operates that are designed to try to move things along. When you get provisional approval, you then have the right to actually get going, and you\'re typically able to spend up to 30% of the value of the project and get reimbursed. Once the government has looked at your project and says that it looks like it\'s pretty good, you have to negotiate a detailed contract, a legally binding contract. It\'s not a perfect solution, but it\'s an example of efforts to try and make sure that the kind of adjudication that\'s needed sometimes with these very complicated projects doesn\'t necessarily slow down the ability to get going.I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about the audit of rural and remote connectivity. This is a crucial issue and one with which my ministry is seized. As long as there are Canadians who are not connected to broadband Internet, we will not be satisfied, and we are as impatient as, I think, others that progress is made on this file. I appreciate the chance to provide an update on what we\'re doing. In June of 2019, the government released Canada\'s first connectivity strategy. It included the goal of connecting all Canadians by 2030.The current plan is focused on broadband access, wireline broadband access. There are funds that have been provided through the strategy for mobile. At this point, we are working to deploy those funds, but it\'s clear that more funding will be required to connect all major roadways with cellular coverage. The investments being made are transformational in scale, and we are only partway through our plan. We know we have a lot more work to do, but I would just like to leave the main message that significant progress has been made.I\'ll provide a brief answer, then ask my colleague Mr. Dagenais to offer a slightly more detailed response. We agree completely that there are significant coverage gaps in rural Canada and in indigenous communities. While there remains a significant gap, I think it\'s contextually worth noting that the gap is closing rapidly. We do expect more than 80% of indigenous communities will have it by the 2026 time period, which is almost a tripling of the communities that have access. It is likely that the 2% we talk about in 2026 will consist of the most remote and difficult communities.We have an agreement with Telesat which was inked a number of years ago to buy capacity in their LEO constellation. We are also working on developing low-earth orbit satellite technology to bring high-speed Internet satellite coverage to the north. We have signed agreements with British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland to date. The scale of the universal broadband fund is quite a bit bigger than previous initiatives of governments past, under all stripes. The UBF is actually the only really significant large-scale broadband program that\'s been launched in the last 20 years.A number of provinces stepped up right away and said, Actually, we would like to match the money and work with you. In effect, it was that activity by the provinces that allowed us to rethink some of the investment, like doing more in fibre optics, for example. We\'re confident that the money we have now will enable us to achieve our goal of connecting 98% of households. What remains to be determined is the amount for the remaining 2% of coverage. We agree with the Auditor General when she says we need to determine how much will be needed to close the gap.Mr. Chair, I want to be as helpful as I can, but I think that question is probably best directed to the provincial government. Heretofore, there was not necessarily an obligation to be connecting households. The program is designed to incentivize companies to step forward and connect households that are unconnected. The record shows that there has been substantial progress in connecting rural and indigenous communities, including in New Brunswick. We want to have 100% coverage by 2030 and 98% by 2026.The biggest challenge at the moment is rolling out major infrastructure projects all across the country. It will take until 2026 for a lot of that cash that\'s going into the ground now, the building that\'s taking place, to produce the result of a house that\'s actually connected. You won\'t see the percentage jump up until the light gets turned on in the house. The pandemic has definitely created supply chain bottlenecks and those sorts of things, but in a sense, it\'s just time. It\'s like building a bridge or something.I would confirm that affordability is the top concern for us in all of our work on telecom, including the universal broadband fund. I think the government has been clear that it has been prepared to make an investment in the Telesat constellation if and when that project proceeds. The key consideration for us is to make sure the price is affordable, appropriate and comparable to market prices in Canada.

The Trudeau Foundation is an agency that was, and I believe continues to be, part of the ministry\'s broad portfolio of organizations. The science sector at ISED derived its mandate for monitoring the Trudeau Foundation from its role in supporting excellence in universities, scholars and research activities across the country. The committee has questions about a meeting of deputy ministers and Trudeau Foundation scholars at the Privy Council Office in 2016.',70,'Mr. John Knubley'),
(775,451453793663981383,'Mr. Garnett Genuis: It was finalized. It was ready to be announced in September 2015. It wasn\'t, because of a technical issue with the University of Montreal part of this, so I. don\'t recall there ever being a red flag about it. Mr. Morris Rosenberg: I think you\'re better to ask Mr. Johnson about the content of that...or ask the forensic auditors themselves. The foundation needs to find a new president, and I think it will be challenging to find one until these issues are clarified.I served under both Conservative and Liberal governments for 15 years as deputy minister variously of justice, health and foreign affairs. I\'ve served as president of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, as an adviser on policy and on various boards. One of the reasons I agreed to serve at the foundation is my belief that there\'s a public interest in strengthening exchanges between academic researchers and policy-makers. In the mid-2010s, Canadian universities, businesses and governments all saw it as being in their interest to strengthen ties with China. I think Prime Minister Harper captured the spirit of the time well in 2013, when he welcomed two Chinese pandas to Toronto.The foundation never coordinated its activities with elected officials, either prior to or after the 2015 election. Conferences on the implications of the rise of China were consistent with our core themes of Canada and the world and human rights. The donors had no say on the content of these conferences, an important consideration for the foundation. There was an allegation of a discrepancy between the name on the tax receipt and the name that was put into the annual report. The annual report is very forthright about the fact that there are Chinese donors behind the donation.There are a lot of questions about why no red flags were raised when I signed the receipt with a Chinese address. The biggest donation was one made by the McCall MacBain Foundation back in about 2016. The decision isn\'t up to me, but I hope the details surrounding the situation can be cleared up fairly quickly, because it\'s vitally important for the foundation. Any concerns of that nature are precisely the kind of thing that an independent review or an investigation by the Canada Revenue Agency should look into.I was not fired from the foundation. There was an intimation at the committee that I was fired. The content of the large public inquiry is going to be decided in discussions between the representatives of all the parties. If it happens that it\'s part of a public inquiry, then the Trudeau Foundation will deal with it. It\'s certainly not helpful. There were no sexual harassment policies in a lot of organizations. As we started to learn more, there was no sexual harassed policy that is correct. I will provide a copy of the letter I chose to provide in this committee.I think everybody understood that we were dealing with a Chinese Communist government. We all felt back then that it was worth the trouble, given that China was the rising superpower in the world. The penny really dropped for us with the hostage-taking of the two Michaels. I think it changed our perception. Anybody who has family left behind in an authoritarian state may be vulnerable to harassment because of what can be done to their families. These things need to be understood and looked at. I really hope that diaspora communities are given a voice.I was the deputy secretary of operations in the PCO before I became the deputy minister of justice. Before that, I was the assistant secretary of economic and regional development policy, starting under the Conservatives at the end of the Mulroney and Kim Campbell regimes. I was always a big believer in hiring political staff. Under both different governments, I hired political staff from the other party. I found that political staff actually had their feet firmly planted on the ground in terms of what\'s practical, in a way that sometimes public servants didn\'t.Peter Fragiskatos: The donation bought no influence. The idea that $200,000 is going to influence any government, I think is absurd. The company made the donation, so the receipt was issued in the company\'s name. I honestly believe that the foundation was operating in good faith and that it wasn\'t influenced, but I do understand that there are public perceptions out there. The foundation cannot wait two or three years to have this clarified. It needs a quicker resolution. There have been a lot of allegations made; there\'s a lotof smoke there.No, the foundation was aware that the cheque, or whatever it was, was deposited into the Bank of Montreal by a Canadian corporation, Millennium Golden Eagle International (Canada) Inc. I don\'t think so, to my knowledge. It\'s not that I wouldn\'t have, but it wouldn\'t be because they were Liberals or Conservatives. As far as I know, the staff at the foundation were pretty apolitical. The biggest donation we ever got was from the McCall MacBain Foundation.Morris Rosenberg: I don\'t think that $200,000 dollars is very significant in the greater scheme of things. The whole world was courting China whether businesses, academic institutions or governments, so when the Government of Canada entered into a customs agreement and a foreign investment protection agreement with China, it thought it was working in the best interests of Canada. I think during the initial period, the concerns were more on the commercial side, the economic side, and on the dual use of technology side.',70,'Mr. Morris Rosenberg'),

First, we had the Beijing influence. We have the questionable donation to the foundation. Most recently, we have a lawsuit launched.Pascale Fournier testified at the ethics committee. She said that her predecessor, Morris Rosenberg, told the National Post in December 2016 that the foundation didn\'t consider the donation to be foreign money. She told MPs that this was actually a statement in the annual report...when in fact the tax receipt itself mentions China. Mr. Rosenberg, you\'re going to be the beneficiary of my questions today.

It\'s not out of the question or unreasonable to ask why or how members of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation and members of these parties are connected.Mr. Rosenberg, I want to get your advice, your knowledge and your experience in relation to how we combat this kind of perception of foreign interference. For example, my own perspective is that we need to have a public inquiry for the purpose of trying to combat the perception of a weakening democracy. I think that\'s an important project, one that is worthwhile and that I think this committee could assist in.

Directors are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the foundation, nor in dealing with the auditors on a case-by-case basis in the financial statements. There\'s nothing in the bylaws. The examination of donations is strict enough to ensure we\'re not being unduly influenced by our donors. The changing of the lives of a number of our scholars has been invaluable, and it continues to be.The Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation is a non-partisan charitable scholarship foundation. It was created in 2002 with broad cross-party support in the House of Commons. The first board of directors included Bill Davis, Roy Romanow and Peter Lougheed. The foundation, over the past 21 years, is doing what it was supposed to do with the taxpayers\' money, says the chair of the board. It has provided 295 doctoral scholarships, plus mentorships and fellowships. We have not asked for a cent of new money from the government in 21 years.The Trudeau Foundation received two $70,000 donations in 2016 and 2017. In March 2023, the foundation sent a cheque in the amount of $140,000 to reimburse the donation. The cheque was signed by directors Bruce McNiven and Peter Sahlas, drawn to the order of Millennium Golden Eagle International (Canada) The bank confirmed on April 23 that both payments were received by electronic transfer from the Canadian corporate entity listed on the CRA receipts that had been issued by the foundation. The foundation is taking the appropriate steps with the CRA in regard to the above.There was no vote in the House, but there were statements of support. The NDP, the Conservatives and the Liberals, etc., were very supportive. It\'s important to remember the words spoken by the legendary Warren Buffett a few years ago:Audit committees can\'t audit. The role of an audit committee is not to study every expenditure, gift or detail. I don\'t believe there\'s a lack of transparency on our part in any way. It comes to a small fraction of 1% of our endowment fund.Mr. Johnson: I have difficulty connecting the allegation in that story with the facts. The amount I want to underline that was actually received by the foundation was $140,000 over two years. The facts don\'t accord with the allegation. The use of a Hong Kong address.... If I make a donation to the Red Cross and I\'m going to be in Florida at tax time, I ask the. Red Cross to send the receipt to me in Florida in a different jurisdiction. That doesn\'t make a difference. I\'m a Canadian taxpayer, and I made the donation.I\'m not convinced by some of these assertions and allegations. With great respect, I have my doubts about.... I have looked at the 160 pages of information relating to it, which I believe was every document that the foundation had. I recall no such allegations or concerns with respect to any of our donations. We have a bright future ahead of us. We hope very soon to be announcing our next cohort of scholars, mentors and fellows. If you want evidence of the solidity of the foundation and its programs, I think that will be it.Mr. Desjarlais: We built the endowment, but we\'re falling short of inflation. As inflation grows and as inflation gets ahead of us, we have a gap to close, he says.

It\'s stunning in terms of what I\'ve seen in almost eight years of having the honour of serving in this committee\"Mrs. Shanahan said a number of interesting things that I want to build on, not to repeat, Mr. Chair. The implications of the work that we do here are far-reaching, and if we were to go forward and support the amendment, then I think we would be running into a real challenge. If we have our tax agency seen as leaking documents, it calls into question what that tax agency ultimately represents. It\'s ultimately going towards creating an environment of mistrust that organizations, whether they are charities or businesses, might have.The Conservatives are trying to obtain documents that are protected under privacy provisions. They want to know about the ins and outs of a particular charity organization or not-for-profit organization. They have privacy rights, as all Canadians have the right to privacy. The Conservatives are opening a huge can of worms here for themselves. They must understand that this does open the path for any member of this committee to put forward a motion to obtain information from any organization, whether it\'s relating to the gun lobby or other organizations close to the Conservative Party.',68,'Mr. Peter Fragiskatos'),

(805,451453793663981443,'I was quite reassured not only by the questions and answers given to the Committee by Canada Revenue Agency officials. In fact, I mentioned that more than 30,000 reports had been sent to the Agency. CRA told us no, and that it would never reveal the identity of a whistleblower. I imagine this is part of CRA s culture, which is reassuring for the general public. We don\'t believe that it s enough, in the wake of an alert, to carry out an investigation that\'s more or less serious and make superficial or hasty decisions.I think all members will agree, especially my Conservative colleagues, that when you\'re dealing with financials, it\'s as close to black and white as one can get. Numbers can be interpreted, but numbers don\'t lie. It\'s always with measured debate and input from all parties as to how a committee could better perform its function and complete its mandate. I am proud that this committee was able, last week using fulsome debate, to come to a good place regarding the invitation of witnesses to this committee.We do not wish to see the Canadian government turn into a bureaucracy. The party that brings in the most MPs then forms the executive end of the government. Public servants are bound not only by their professional ethics, by their training and by their education. They must conduct their duties in a way that is compliant with the law of the land. That includes keeping certain documents and certain pieces of information confidential. It is extremely unfortunate when committees just become a place to destroy reputations and hurl accusations behind the veil of privilege.I would never want to see this committee, even if there is a majority of members who wish to conduct a certain study or to go about it in a certain way, do a study without any consideration whatsoever for the concerns and objections of other committee members. That, Mr. Chair, is a bridge too far. I am adamant as I have seen it work in this committee that there be a way to work toward a common understanding of how we conduct ourselves and how we continue in the review of documents, and that it always be with respect to the law.The Canada Revenue Agency receives over 30,000 leads each year on alleged tax or benefit cheating. The agency gives charities a chance to correct non-compliance with an education letter. If it\'s not corrected, then they will move to a compliance agreement. Since 2006-07, 25 charities have been revoked for reasons that included a disbursement quota shortfall, the CRA says. The ultimate.... I think it probably could go further to charges, but certainly their registration would be withdrawn in that case.I find this so reassuring to know we can ask questions and get these kinds of detailed answers. No one wants to hear about a leak from CRA. Nobody wants that. I dare say that I\'d be the first in line and I know I\'d have colleagues with me demanding for the head of any official who allowed a leak to occur. That information is kept private, but those investigations are undertaken. Eventually, if they do fall into the public view in a court scenario, and so on, we do have the results and rightfully so.',68,'Mrs. Brenda Shanahan'),

That is their business and that is their right as members of Parliament.I\'ll leave it at that.Thanks, Chair. I would ask that they find out if there is another charity that is involvedI would welcome the government\'s launching any investigation into any of the entities that he mentioned if they are also ones that are named after the father of the current Prime Minister. The answer that came back was a word salad, basically. We\'ve seen the CRA prosecuting faith-based charities, apparently just on a whim or perhaps politically based or racism based. The Ontario supreme court made it very clear about Islamophobia being involved in the prosecution of a charity. We asked about that and we did not get any answers.

If we re not in a position to answer them today, we could set this aside and come back to it after we ve made enquiries, especially with our colleagues on the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.

By law, the Canada Revenue Agency is responsible for conducting an investigation. We need to ensure Canadians have confidence in these organizations when they make donations. It\'s always possible to give an organization or foundation a new name. The fact remains, however, that the mission and raison d\'etre of the organization remain the same. The proposal does not aim for transparency, but rather at making copy the Journal de Montr al.The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that he is no longer involved with the Foundation, which is absolutely correct. When a foundation chooses a certain name, it\'s a badge of honour of sorts. It\'s because it wants to represent the same values as the person who bore that name. There\'s a reason we have agencies to monitor and investigate all of this. These agencies can call for corrective action, impose fines and go as far as laying more serious charges.

Different programs have different levels of affordability attached to them because they target different people. It\'s difficult to say that people who work in our cities and who are being priced out of the rental market don\'t also need help with rentals. We need to have a national housing strategy that, yes, focuses a lot on the most vulnerable, but we also need more rental supply. No, I made my response. I just said I don\'t need your help.Homelessness affects every community in Canada. It preys on the most vulnerable amongst us, casting a shadow over their lives. As a government, we have recognized this and we have heeded the call to action. The Government of Canada has responded through Reaching Home, Canada\'s homelessness strategy. Launched in 2019, the program committed $2.2 billion to address homelessness across the country. It has now grown to almost $4 billion in funding. Budgets 2021 and 2022 strengthened this initiative to further empower communities so that they can better address the needs of individuals and families.Budget 2023 reaffirmed the Government of Canada\'s commitment to the things that matter most to Canadians. We will continue to make housing more affordable and end chronic homelessness in Canada. We can\'t do it alone. We have to continue to work with other levels of government, indigenous organizations and communities across the country. We are improving housing outcomes and reducing homelessness for Canada\'s vulnerable populations. Every Canadian deserves a place to build a better life. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the honourable member for pointing out the success of our efforts, which are based on really trusting the communities.Canada is building about 200,000 units a year, but we know that\'s not enough to meet the demand for affordable housing. The 2022 budget introduces measures so we can double that number over the next decade. More than $14 billion in additional federal funding has been allocated to help create more housing. Reaching Home is about the services. These are 5,000 projects that include employment supports. It includes counselling, mental health supports and addiction supports. These programs are delivered by organizations on the ground, not by CMHC.Housing is not just a federal responsibility. We have committed to cutting chronic homelessness in half by 2027-28 and then eliminating chronic homelessness by 2030. We\'ve invested $454.3 million to provide 145,000 Quebec households with monthly assistance under the Canada-Quebec housing agreement. We\'re also taking action by providing an additional $500 to those and other eligible families. This amount will be paid to 1.8 million Canadians, including 467,000Quebec households.

If one of the law enforcement entities passes along information to us information that they have on activities of a criminal nature we can incorporate that into our thinking.The Canada Revenue Agency administers the provisions of the Income Tax Act as they relate to registered charities. The agency is committed to enhancing the transparency and accountability of charities by providing relevant information about charities to the public at large. The CRA reviews every allegation made or the information it receives to determine if there was non-compliance with the legislation it administers. It cannot provide any feedback or updates on leads it receives or subsequent actions taken, including whether an audit is ongoing, unless an audit results in a charity being revoked or annulled.Sharmila may be able to talk about the penalty.

The AG would like to see more transparency and accountability in the public accounts office. The auditor general would like the Evidence Act to be amended to give him more access to the information he needs to do his audit in a timely way. The Auditor General would also like to increase the number of CPA graduates in the federal public service, particularly in the Black community.The Office of the Auditor General of Canada serves Canada through leadership and partnerships in audits that support trust in public institutions and continued public service excellence. In 2021 22, our net operating cost was $126.1 million, and we employed the equivalent of 727 full-time employees. With these resources, we reported on 12 performance audits and three special examinations of Crown corporations. We also audited the financial statements of 90 federal and territorial government organizations and Crown corporations, including those of the Public Accounts of Canada. We issued clean opinions on 86 of these financial statements.We measure how many hours it takes to deliver certain audits. We always challenge auditors to be more effective and efficient at their audits. While we\'ve adopted a motto of coming in for a minimum of 37.5 hours, we\'ve implemented a hybrid work policy that should cover the majority of people. If you want to permanently telework or have a different arrangement, then you get a telework arrangement. We believe that we should walk the talk to ensure that we hold every audit entity to adopting sustainable development strategies.In a typical year, I\'d say that about two-thirds of our auditors are financial auditors. We audit most of the parent Crown corporations, but not necessarily their subsidiaries. The Auditor General Act makes me accountable and responsible for setting the terms and conditions for all employees unless they are represented by a bargaining agent. It was very clear to me that I was negotiating within the mandate given to my office by Parliament. I was able to speak to the Treasury Board, but I cannot change the envelope that is given to us.The majority of the public service had already negotiated and settled agreements within the mandate. The intention is to come in a minimum of that in a month. We aren\'t following the minimum two to three days per week, but if more public servants are downtown or in the office buildings and we are auditing them, chances are we will be there more often as well. I\'m really happy to see the increase in committees looking at the work of our office. I think it is important to give back to standard setting and to encourage more accountable governments.We\'re seeing an increase as we turn more to data visualization. We\'re seeing a lot more time spent on the charts or the infographics that we develop with our work. We have made many strides across the organization in meeting our employment equity targets. We see those really as the minimum expectations, and we strive to exceed them.We have made improvements in our indigenous representation, but we still have a lot of work left to do. I\'d like to speak about four amendments that could be made to the Auditor General Act.The modernize pillar impacts both internally and externally. We need to modernize our own internal functions so that we can be more efficient. Increasing diversity across our management is definitely a step that we need to take. We\'ve done a lot of training and awareness work across the organization on indigenous matters, on unconscious bias and on equity and diversity.I believe it\'s a cornerstone of the independence of my office to be able to pick who we audit, when we audit and what we audit. The mandate doesn\'t allow us to look at other donors or private donations and the sources of those funds.Our goal is to hit 25 performance audits in the year that just ended and in the coming year. To move up the publication of the Public Accounts of Canada would require collaboration among us, the Receiver General and the comptroller general\'s office. We audit most of the parent Crown corporations, and so probably already audit some of the information that is likely being requested by Parliament to make it into the public accounts. A lot of that information is already available in the individual financial statements of the Crowns.There is always an opportunity to improve the financial statements, but the opinion has been clean so far. We do have commentary and opportunities for improvement, however, which we issue in our financial commentary. There are some long-standing issues around the management of inventory at the Department of National Defence. We consider environmental factors before we embark on a new round of audits in a given year, as everything continues to change. It\'s quite an extensive process, and it is constantly turning.

(889,451453793663981611,'I was trying to focus in on where we can truly assess the value of Canada\'s investment. It was not at all to give them a break but to be able to target and show the value to Canadians. When you\'re spending $3.5 billion, accounting for it in million-dollar tranches is difficult. You need to have a global picture to even decide whether or not you should reallocate funds to a certain area of the world. We saw project managers doing a good job using the tools, but you need to set yourself up to monitor the right things.Global Affairs Canada committed to funding projects to improve gender equality and the conditions of the world\'s poorest and most marginalized populations. Audit focused on whether the department supported gender equality in low- and middle-income countries. Report found that the department was unable to demonstrate that its spending improved the lives of women and girls. The department focused on short-term outputs, with only 2 of 26 policy indicators measuring outcomes, the audit found. The report recommended that theDepartment take immediate action so that it can fully report on the outcomes of the projects it funded.Only 35 of the 619 projects we looked at were contained in the external reporting. The one file missing is actually a file in Ukraine. I hear clear goodwill and desire from the deputy to put something in place in the interim. It\'s a lot of money, and hopefully it really drives an impactful and important change for women and girls across the world.

(890,451453793663981613,'I think our official development assistance is one of the primary tools in Canada\'s tool kit.

We need to be there to help developing countries do that as well. South Korea is now an important trading partner with Canada. It is a thriving democracy in a world in which democracy is in retreat. we need more South Koreas for Canada.Audit highlights the importance of Canada\'s feminist international assistance policy. Report also noted the urgent need for Global Affairs to improve its monitoring and reporting on the results of our work. Canada\'s development assistance programming is making a tangible contribution to improving the lives of women and girls. Canada works with partners across the globe to support the development of more inclusive communities and to achieve poverty reduction. Global Affairs Canada is committed to improving how we ensure that every development project receives a full gender-based analysis, including questions of intersectionality. The department will immediately launch a review of the changes made in 2020.Global Affairs Canada has adjusted its approach, with a clear focus on gender equality. In everything from the distribution of food aid, it takes into consideration the needs of women and girls. A gender-based analysis is used for two reasons: to determine exactly what type of a project it is. The other thing it does is that it enables us to help the partners to better integrate the gender learnings we have on the ground in their work. The platform we are currently using is expiring. We\'re using that as an opportunity to rethink the entire process of grants and contributions.An internal audit in 2021 noted there were difficulties with Global Affairs Canada\'s information management system. \"We absolutely have to have a centralized system to which everyone has access,\" he says. \"I had no concerns, to be honest, that we wouldn\'t be able to find the documents\" \"We have completely integrated the idea that we need to manage our relations with our partners better\" \"The size of the budget that we\'re managing is something that we have to address immediately,\" he adds.All of the aid we undertake is driven by a feminist approach to delivering international assistance. Every single project receives the analysis to tell us what is possible, what is needed and what we should do within each and every project. We have very long-term relationships with some multilateral organizations, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Since the feminist international assistance policy, we continue to support that organization, but we have taken a far more aggressive role on the board.The problem is in being able to roll that up, 1,500 individual projects, all with individual project indicators. This is a difficulty that extends across all donors, and it includes organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank. The Nordic countries calculate only the results at the project level. They simply accept that in this area, the issue relates to the projects. The ability to take the results from individual projects...because that is the fundamental unit of account that my team and I hold ourselves to is fundamental.For most of our partner countries, each one is doing it in a slightly different way. We all function in more or less the same way, which is the fundamental project is the unit of account. For some countries, such as the Nordic ones, for the most part they\'ve decided to not try. They\'ve decided that the best approach is to focus on an effective discussion and reporting on results at the project level. For example, a significant portion of our development assistance spending goes to large multilateral organizations.The Auditor General looked at 10 projects approved between 2017 and 2020. Many of those projects were not completed yet at the time of the audit. Global Affairs Canada will launch a review to verify that the changes made in 2020 respond to the findings that the Auditor General had of projects that existed prior to 2020. In 2020, significant changes were made to our approach to doing gender-based analysis. We added those criteria of, as I\'ve said, ethnicity, race, religion and age. That should be integrated into the way that projects are designed and rolled out.I can assure you that those three commitments are tracked very regularly. We\'ve been tracking them since the moment the policy was launched. The difficulty with a percentage target, however, is that we don\'t always control the denominator. The teams that are in place are fully capable of doing the job. They want to see results more than anybody else does. They\'re the ones on the ground working directly with partners to do this.Maybe I can turn to Patricia, who\'s going to be leading the ground work.',58,'Mr. Christopher MacLennan'),

The Auditor General: I would appreciate a written follow-up if there are things you haven\'t had a chance to say.Auditor General: Government\'s policy indicators are not actually linked to outcomes. The difference between an output and an outcome is something like this. If you\'re measuring outputs and not outcomes, then you\'re not actually measuring whether or not you\'re making a difference. The government didn\'t have complete information on multiple projects, but we\'re going to charitably assume that they didn\'t exclude information because it was inconvenient. They didn\'t provide it because they didn’t have it. It\'s a problem of policy and administrative failure on the part of the government.Mr. McLennan: We\'re not tracking or testing to see if our policy is having the intended effect of making life better for women and girls around the world.

The Treasury Board is planning on following up on this report on a faster basis than we would normally do, Hayes says.Federal departments are increasingly moving software applications and databases into the cloud, including some that handle or store Canadians\' personal information. The audit found that the departments we audited did not always implement and follow the controls the government has set out to protect information that is stored and transmitted using the cloud. This leaves cloud-based information vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which are increasingly frequent and sophisticated.

Shared Services provides controlled and secure access to the cloud environment at the enterprise scale. SSC is working closely with the Treasury Board Secretariat to strengthen guardrail validation and enforcement and to ensure coordination with departments. We are still in the early stages of cloud adoption; therefore, enhancement and maturing of the processes are expected.Costas: We are monitoring compliance of each department right now. It\'s just that it\'s not automated. Automation is the way for us to get an alert if a guardrail is being changed by a department user. The guardrails we have today will continue to evolve and be perfected over time. We cannot lose the level of security we have built around the traditional data centre just because we are using a new [Inaudible Editor]. We find a way to integrate that. We are never done with this.Mr. Chair, it would be a great pleasure to respond to this. I think the point the Auditor General made at the beginning of the report is very important. Everything is at risk, and we need to always validate and enhance our safeguards. We are lucky. We need to invest in this all the time, because we have to practise. It\'s good that we are doing tests, but real life also tests our ability to work together. What is in the cloud is really tiny. Some departments are more advanced than others. This is going to change in the future.In this day and age, if we want to provide agile services and deal with peak demand, we have to be digital. Right now, a lot of the infrastructure at the Canada Revenue Agency depends on what we call mainframe . This was the best thing you could have, when the cloud did not exist. Now, the cloud can bring the kind of high-computing capacity and high velocity we only had with the mainframe, in the past.

(924,451453793663981681,'In terms of a dollar value, from an overall government perspective I think the digital spend that we do is substantial.

The way that government funds, at least to my understanding and I\'m by no means an expert is on annual rolling basis or a programmatic view. It is also done in a very decentralized way, and that is where I would say we have challenges.Only 35% of the systems in the Government of Canada are in a healthy state. The cloud is a key to modernizing those systems. We will continue to strengthen oversight and compliance mechanisms for cloud use across government to make sure there\'s very clear guidance and compliance. Cloud first was exactly the right strategy for the government to move forward. We needed to start directing people into new technology. We have got the ship moving in the right direction, for lack of a better way of saying it.I think we are experiencing things that are very similar to what other organizations do at this stage of our maturity. The reason we\'re shifting from cloud-first to cloud-smart, first of all, is that using the cloud allows us to stand things up very quickly. Where we would take potentially months to stand up an environment in which we can start building a new system for Canadians, we can do that in hours or days in cloud. There\'s a huge opportunity to move more quickly to deliver service to Canadians.The Government of Canada is migrating systems and information to the cloud for a couple of reasons. I would just note that our progress is very slow when you compare it to that of other organizations I\'ve worked for. It\'s my belief that we have enough checks and balances in place, including, when we turn something over into production, a checklist that we go through that allows us to manage that risk. There are benefits for keeping things modern and not getting behind that. I think it\'s a dual purpose to provide cloud environments to us.There are two scenarios that we would look at, and I\'ll turn to my colleague from SSC to complement the answer. One is to get out of an old data centre and manage that risk. The second is that we\'re building something net new, which we did during COVID and will continue to do. As our consumption goes down with a cloud provider, our bill goes down. There are advantages as we start to tune and calibrate that will be reflected in cost savings. I think from an overall MP perspective and ministerial perspective it\'s just to support the fact that Canada is falling behind globally in digital delivery.The Auditor General\'s findings have to do with automation and making sure we have put in place a good compliance framework. The cloud still allows us to have all of the protections that the Centre for Cyber Security provides. It is my mission to go out and have many more people come in and do a tour of service within government doing digital work.

These four audits cover a variety of government activities, yet they are linked by a common thread. That thread is inclusion.

We found that a lot of the data was inaccurate. The government is really just tracking price and comparing prices to ensure they remain affordable, and I believe that\'s missing half the story. While you can expand access across the country, it doesn\'t mean that households will pick up the Internet service if it isn\'t affordable.There are many regulations for websites in order to make them accessible. We looked at the Via Rail and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority websites. About 15% to 17% of the regulations had not yet been met. The Canadian Transportation Agency has only four individuals who actually monitor all of the service providers and the over 400 different regulations. It can take several years to meet an objective to meet such as improving hygiene in schools, says West Block\'s John MacIntosh. The West Block is currently occupied on West Block, which is over and above the West Block.Public Services and Procurement Canada needs to find ways to improve decision-making. The training of supervisors and executives is just as essential as that of those who actually deliver the services. I would point to the slowness in the approval of some of the funding projects that are available. The fact that they are now moving back to in-person inspections will, I believe, help improve the oversight mechanism, and then, hopefully, help remove barriers. The accessibility requirements in Canada and the United States are rather similar.Four out of 10 households in rural and remote communities have no Internet. Canada\'s connectivity strategy is absolutely making progress. There\'s just a lot left to be done, when you think about how many households still don\'t have access. We found that funding is available, it\'s just slow to see projects approved and get rolled out. It is important to have good collaboration and speak to stakeholders in order to know their needs, pain points and concerns, the auditor general says.. Twenty-four out of 26 of 26 indicators really just looked at results along the way, but not outcomes. I\'ll give you an example, about providing nutritious meals to women. They may track how many meals were delivered, but then they did not set themselves up to monitor whether health would improve.Four months, to my mind, is a great amount of time, and we weren\'t able to analyze in detail all 60 files we would have liked to. There was no standardized approach to storing that information or gathering it. We looked at whether or not Via Rail\'s website and CATSA\'s website met all of the accessibility requirements.

I look forward to being part of that work, and I lookforward to the report of the committee.Thank you.Minister of Indigenous Services: We fully agree with the Auditor General\'s report. First nations people are on the front lines of climate change. We need to continue aggressive funding and action, and to dismantle the colonial ways that haven\'t served first nations very well, he says. Minister: We\'re updating emergency management plans to reflect today\'s realities and support first nations to make informed decisions. We\'re actively finding solutions to address unfunded structural mitigation reports. As I said, the multilateral approach provides for preplanning and coordination if and when emergencies occur.I see my role as minister as being to press for service excellence and transformation, but also to seek the additional investments that we\'ll need to support better emergency management services and preparedness for first nations. In 2010, as I mentioned, there were 92 reported emergencies, in 2022, 173. The frequency of events, I mentioned in my remarks, is just astronomical. In the past, while communities were in the chaos of trying to manage crisis, there was a fairly restrictive approach to getting money to them. What they needed was the ability to have some form of advance payment.In general, the gap is huge; you\'re absolutely right. In terms of emergency management, the challenge the department has increasingly had is that the need to respond is increasing and growing. There is a fiscal challenge in meeting simultaneously the urgency of the response measures that you have to take quickly when there is a crisis. I will never stop advocating for equity for indigenous peoples. I fully appreciate the pain and rage that you\'re expressing, and I feel it every time I am in a community. I take personal responsibility for my work as a member of Parliament and a cabinet minister.It\'s a colonial country with a history of determining for indigenous people what they will live through and endure. We\'re working on principles of co-development with first nation peoples. We are now looking to be a supportive partner in those kinds of decisions and doing so in an accountable way together. It\'s important to distinguish between what takes the most time, which is infrastructure, and what we can rapidly put into place, such as equipment. That approach whereby we are supporting communities to purchase equipment and we\'re supporting communities with advance payments is the change.I think the short answer is yes. I mean, we are spending more towards the kinds of things that make equity more foreseeable in first nations communities, but I would say that the gap is still very large. I think the principle of truth, equity and self-determination, which is how the department governs itself, requires us to be fiercely honest with ourselves. We have significantly and intentionally underfunded indigenous people over 150 years; and that we are all now trying to figure out how best to get through this together.

We have a trilateral arrangement with our ice service and the ice service in the United States, which is part of NOAA, and also with the international ice patrol for tracking icebergs. We actually deliver service seamlessly among the organizations.',51,'Mr. Ken Macdonald'),

Your argument sounds to me like you\'re not in favour of any disclosure because of the Auditor General\'s report. I\'m just looking for relevance. Mr. Fragiskatos, you have the floor, Mr.Fragiskatos. You\'re not the last. One of your colleagues is next. Thank you. The Chair: We are adjourned.The committee is meeting today to undertake a study of Report 6, Arctic Waters Surveillance, of the 2022 Reports 5 to 8 of the Auditor General of Canada. Each of the four members will have six minutes. I will be watching the clock very closely, but I will have to cut witnesses off if you don\'t leave them ample time to answer your questions. The last 30 minutes is for committee business. We are now in session. Mr. Dong, the chair, has two brief questions.The motion is not calling on the Auditor General to break her contract with the government; it\'s calling on Public Services and Procurement Canada to release this information. The Auditor General is not the target of this motion, nor should she be. She has a contractual obligation not to release a document. The government, of course, is answerable to Parliament and this committee. The calendar is far from full, and if we don\'t resolve this today, this debate will then begin to impact our calendar. There could very well be objections from the government. I vote to keep this meeting in public.The government is answerable to Parliament and this committee. If the committee requests documents, the government is duty-bound to provide them. In my experience, the law clerk will have comments. I\'ll speak to our clerk about seeing, perhaps, what\'s been done in the past. Given what Madame Sinclair-Desgagn has proposed, keeping this information private actually goes above and beyond what a parliamentary committee is required to do. The fact that she\'s done that goes a long way and I think answers the question of whether it safeguards the information.Mr. Anthony Housefather: I view that as an abridgement of the rights of parliamentarians, along with the NDA. Mr. Fragiskatos: My question is simply, what\'s wrong with Parliament? Mr. McCauley: I\'ll double-check with the clerk with the company that did contact me about the motion, but because of our privilege, he didn\'t get into discussion about which is available. Ms. Shanahan: If they want to speak, they can put their hands up.Ms. Bradford, I\'m going to ask you to speak to the motion. Mr. Desjarlais, I\'d be happy to put you on the list, but I\'d like to just proceed as we have been. Ms. Shanahan, I believe Mr. Housefather is next in the speaking order. Is there any chance that you are willing to withdraw your motion, sir? Mr. Fragiskatos, you have the floor.Thank you very much. Thank you for your time.',50,'The Chair'),

The departments should cooperate to establish the ways the ships could meet the requirements and needs contained in the strategy. The problem is one of implementation. There are many reasons why projects such as this strategy can get bogged down. I will say that, obviously, the remoteness of the north makes it difficult to get supplies up there. I\'ll ask Mr. Swales to add to this.In recent decades, Canada\'s Arctic waters have become more accessible as summer sea ice has declined and navigation technologies have improved. Growing maritime traffic increases the risk of unauthorized access, illegal activities, and safety and pollution incidents. Effective surveillance in the Arctic relies on marine vessels, aircraft, and satellites, all of which are aging. The government urgently needs to address these long standing issues and put equipment renewal on a sustainable path to protect Canada\'s interests in the Alaska.

We\'re involved in a lot of different activities with respect to illegal and unreported fishing, which is a problem all over the world. The Indo-Pacific strategy, I would note, includes funding for a shared ocean fund. That is intended to be used, at least in part, to do more on illegal and reported fishing with other countries. The Fisheries Act is updated every five years, and there is a further review of the act coming up in 2024.Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard agree with the audit recommendations. We are committed to working with partners to address gaps in Arctic maritime domain awareness, and increase information sharing. We will continue to collaborate with our federal, provincial and territorial partners, first nations, Inuit and M tis communities, as well as industry, to provide the assets, programs, tools and people needed to support Canada\'s surveillance, presence and maritime security interests. The Coast Guard remains actively engaged with its domestic partners on Arctic security through its contributions to Canada\'s multi-agency marine security operation centres.I\'ll start and then ask the commissioner to provide more detail. We have been doing a lot with indigenous communities in the north and expanding the Coast Guard Auxiliary. With that, we provide funding to purchase community boats so communities can have more of an on-sea presence. We\'ve been piloting a community-based coastal marine response network, which is really intended to be an information-sharing network for what\'s happening on the water.

The overall program costs for AOPS one to six are approximately $5 billion. There indeed have been some operational issues identified that are the subject of some ongoing work with DND. We have completed six large vessels through the national shipbuilding strategy.The national shipbuilding strategy is one of the largest and most significant endeavours undertaken by Canada. It focuses on not just equipping the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard with much-needed vessels, but also strengthening Canada\'s shipyards and rebuilding Canada\'s marine industry. In June of last year, the Government of Canada announced the beginning of negotiations with Chantier Davie of L vis, Quebec to become the third strategic shipbuilding partner under the NSS.

I think we owe it to taxpayers, not just to their unelected lords and masters in the bureaucracy, to at least give them access to their elected officials. I see absolutely no reason why elected members by themselves cannot be given access to what seems to be public in other countries, though not yet in Canada.

(1018,451453793663981869,'The Russian fleet is very different from what we have in Canada, where we have the Coast Guard and we have DND and a navy ship. There is kind of a mix, so that\'s why I said I don\'t exactly know. We went to the North Pole a number of times to map the continental shelf. It happens that the Russians are around there, but never in what is known as Canadian waters. It would be a regulatory change. If a ship is sailing through Canadian waters but doesn\'t make land, they don\'t have to report. If they are coming to a port, they have toReport within 48 hours.The Kiwi Roa was the first one that we know of that went into the Canadian Arctic. Only ships that are more than 350 gross tonnes have to report to NORDREG. Most of the traffic in the Arctic right now is large vessels greater than 350 tonnes. The Coast Guard doesn\'t have that capability, but we receive all the ice information we receive through RADARSAT, for use of industry and for the use of the Coast Guard. It\'s a great quality of life. That\'s what we\'re getting.We\'re getting our imagery from Environment Canada. We also have all our ships up north do observation, our helicopters do reconnaissance, and we\'re starting to use drones more and more as well. The feedback we have received from the navy is that they are much more efficient than expected. I think we\'re not going to get a program icebreaker a year from now, I think the delivery date is scheduled for 2030. We\'re doubling up on the design work. Everything is lining up to start construction, to cut steel, in 2025.In the world of digitalization right now, I think there\'s no other option. We need to make better use of that. For instance, if you see some oil in the water, how can you report it? You don\'t have to search for a phone number. We\'ll have an app dedicated to that, where you will be able to take a picture and report what you are seeing. If Nanisivik is operational, we will use it. If not, we\'ll continue the way we\'ve been going, through bringing tankers and barges.',50,'Mr. Mario Pelletier'),
(1019,451453793663981871,'Under the legislation governing what she does, the Auditor General Act, she\'s required to censor the content of commercial agreements. Some findings, particularly those dealing with wasted doses, could be explained in the contracts. For example, pharmaceutical companies may have prohibited the Government of Canada from reselling vaccine doses. If such provisions were included in the contract with pharmaceutical companies, this would explain why many doses were wasted. In that case, it would be up to us as parliamentarians to find out why the pharmaceutical companies abused their position of power.The committee will study the contracts between Public Services and Procurement Canada with Moderna, Sanofi, Pfizer, Medicago, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax for the supply of COVID 19 vaccines (Auditor General\'s Reports 9 and 10) The committee will hold a two-hour in camera meeting. No personal mobile or electronic devices will be permitted in the room during the meeting. The motion has been presented in good faith, and I trust there is no reason to prevent a debate on it.Committee on Public Accounts will look at documents in camera, under certain constraints that have been described in the motion. We will also do so in an in camera meeting with representatives of Public Services and Procurement Canada. This exercise is purely an exercise in transparency. There are no lives at stake. These are commercial contracts with pharmaceutical companies. It is in the interest of the Canadians and Quebeckers we represent to know what was in these agreements. It has been done in the United States, in Europe and in Colombia. This is completely out of order.The motion proposes measures to protect the confidentiality of required documents, including that the documents be available for viewing only in the clerk\'s office, for one day only. The level of redactions required by the NDAs on COVID vaccine procurement contracts is unprecedented. The NDAs allow pharmaceutical companies to hold an unfair advantage over the price of vaccines. For example, AstraZeneca sold vaccines to South Africa at 2.5 times the price per dose that European governments paid. By conditioning desperately needed vaccines on the signing of NDA agreements, pharmaceutical companies force governments to violate international standards of transparency.',50,'Ms. Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagn'),

That means that the action plan had not produced the expected results. Some measures had still not been implemented. Work remains to be done. The strategy includes four main departments.

I still stand by my words that we all have a job, and our job on this committee is to be able to review these contracts. That is how the motion reads now, that we discuss that in camera. We review those contracts in camera and Canadians are better assured, or we continue down this path of creating more and more confidentiality clauses to continuously and onerously fetter Parliament.Inuit people have many stories. When I visit them, they know exactly where many ships have gone missing. It\'s important that the expertise of Inuit folks is actually held to be of importance by the ministry and by your officials. It was mentioned several times by both the DFO and Public Services that this is one of the areas of last resort for the country. Is the fleet, the assets we currently have in the north, capable of actually responding to environmental catastrophe in the way Canadians would expect? Is it tailored for that solution?I take exception to the fact that any of us would breach our requirements for in camera sessions. In camera is a very important forum that even the government benches acknowledged the importance of just a minute ago by moving to go in camera. I recognize that this is in the interest of Canadians. Canadians deserve to know that MPs have access to incredibly sensitive and important documents on what the government dealing with, particularly in this public accounts committee. It\'s certainly a difference between the Government of Canada and Parliament of Canada, from my perspective, should not have the possibility of breaching confidentiality with companies.The committee is considering an amendment to the Public Accounts Act. The amendment would require the government to hand over documents to the committee. The motion from the Bloc Qu b cois and the amendment from the government differ on how to do this. The committee is expected to vote on the amendment on Tuesday. The bill is expected in the House of Commons by the end of the week. The government says the amendment is needed to ensure the interests of Canadians are met in the public accounts process.I\'m really torn on this, because I think the interest of Canadians would demand not just of me but of all of us as committee members to take that approach. I think there has to be an established risk, a great risk, if we are to ask members to sign an NDA to view documents that are within the purview and the responsibility of this committee. The motion itself establishes risk-mitigating factors from the letter from the law clerk of Parliament, which has outlined several recommendations. Those safeguards are built into the member of the Bloc Qu b cois\'s motion.I believe the perceived risk would have to be greater than the principle of oversight in this case. Risk to the government is different from risk to Parliament. The institutions that built this country and the institution that we\'re in right now have built safeguards to ensure that a thing like this could very well be done in a secure place like Parliament and done in camera. I would like to give the government one last opportunity to read into the Bloc Qu b cois motion. I believe that the intention is to ensure there\'s oversight for Canadians.\"I don\'t think we can say that the Bloc Qu b cois motion will bring risk to the government\" \"The safeguards that are being imposed by the amendment are onerous, I believe, and, to the chair\'s statement, could breach privilege\" \"I believe and have faith in our institutions and that when we go in camera in a closed setting, we will not breach that confidence\" \"This is not the government. The Parliament is requesting that this information be presented to us, and safeguards are in place\"The committee is considering a motion to look at commercial contracts entered into by the government. The motion was tabled by the Bloc Qu b cois, which wants the documents readily available in conditions that continue to keep them confidential. The committee is concerned that the government\'s interest in protecting the government from liability is outweighing its commitment to having transparency for Canadians. \"The only difference between the motion and the amendment is that you want to bring liability to these members by having them sign an NDA,\" the committee\'s chair says.I\'m disappointed in the level of obstruction and attacks I\'ve just heard from the opposite members. I\'ve done my best to try to get to a consensus position that would guarantee the members of this committee, including the Liberals, a confidential process where you could review this information. It\'s a request of your colleagues on behalf of Canadians. I don\'t believe, as Ms. Shanahan said, that this is a highly partisan request. If it were highly partisan, the option would be to amend the Bloc Qu b cois\' motion, take out all the procedures that would protect the government in camera.MPs are being asked to sign NDAs to protect the government\'s dealings with private companies. The move could lead to MPs being shut down in their ability to second documents, MP says. \"We\'re talking about a commercial contract. There\'s nothing to hide here,\" he says. MPs will go in camera to review the documents and we\'ll protect them, he adds. \"That is the compromise you want on this scale,\" the MP says of the NDA request. \"You\'re asking for extraordinary circumstances in extraordinary circumstances\"The law clerk has been clear. We can do this. We\'re not asking. It\'s a demand. You can\'t do whatever you want in this place. There\'s oversight that\'s reasonable, and that oversight is being presented to you in a reasonable way. The narrow interest of protecting these contracts is not worth it, my friends. To sacrifice so much, to go this far, I\'m aghast by it. To use this much time and effort.... I\'ll talk all day, because that\'s obviously what\'s going to happen here. If I give up this time, you\'re going to go on forever.MPs have the right to review government contracts in camera, says committee chair. \"Why would a government seek to make something secret, knowing that Parliament could make it un-secret?\" he asks. \"It\'s unfortunate that we\'ve evolved into the position we\'re in now\" \"You can do what you accused us of doing and have a narrow perspective,\" he says of the government\'s position. \"Or you can do the right thing and look out for the interests at public accounts\"MPs are being asked to sign an NDA to prevent them from releasing documents in camera. The motion was brought forward by the Bloc of Canada, which is part of the Liberal Party. \"I believe everyone in this place is a good, reasonable person,\" the MP says. \"We have a job to do and there are interests involved. I can see your interests very clearly. I\'d hope that you can see our interests as clearly as well, and see that our interests are paramount here\"Committee Chair Blake Desjarlais asks members to consider their constituents\' views on the issue. The committee is one of the oldest standing committees in the country for this purpose. The Bloc Qu b cois, New Democrats and even Conservatives are willing to go in camera to protect the confidentiality of these agreements, DesJarlais says. \"These things have just never happened for commercial contracts,\" he says, \"and it\'s shocking to know that contracts were even entered into this way\"I would hate to see this motion voted on and just the opposition. We need co-operative members to see that the value and import of Canadians to this issue is critical. The motion, the way it reads now, does have the quality of best ensuring protection and important aspects of confidentiality. I\'m not willing to allow a precedent that would disproportionately harm all future committees this way to become the standard or norm when any private contracts are dealt with.

Whatever view they held, it\'s not automatic that our side would be forced to agree with it.Mr. Housefather: We have a willingness, on our side, to go back to PSPC in this case and ask for their perspective on the entire issue of NDAs in just a few days.

If, after 30 days, the committee has not received a response, or the committee is not satisfied with the responses, members will be asked to sign NDAs. The contracts would be provided by PSPC in a predetermined Government of Canada secure location.Liberal MP Blake Shepherd says the committee is not here to defend the pharmaceutical companies. He says the documents were signed at the beginning of the pandemic, when everybody was desperate for vaccines. Shepherd: The only difference between this amendment to the motion and the motion itself is the location: one is the clerk\'s office, and one is in a secure location where these types of documents are normally accessed. \"We\'re just saying that parliamentarians can access it in a location that is close by,\" he says.I don\'t know how that\'s possible, unless you\'re arguing that somehow there is another source of funding I am not aware of. The risks, I think, again would be that somehow we didn\'t follow the procedure in the contract, and then the information became public and the supplier had a loss and sued for damages. It could be that another country had a different price and suddenly saw that Canada\'s price was better and then got all upset with the supplier. There certainly could be.... Now, how high a risk that is, I don\'t think I\'m equipped to assess.I believe that in most countries they are highly confidential agreements. I\'d be very surprised if the Canadian ones are that different from the ones signed with most of our allies in most other countries. I believe this is a good-faith attempt to find a way for everybody to quickly see all the documents in an unredacted way. If anybody has another suggestion to deal....I\'m going to make one other suggestion, Mr. Chair, because I think that was also Mr. Desjarlais\'s question.The main risk is related to the supplier who is upset, potentially sues us and potentially doesn\'t want to do business with us in the future. I find it very insulting when they say that employees of the civil service can access things and parliamentarians can\'t. I am willing to go back to the department to ask them to go to all these suppliers the pharmaceutical companies that have agreements and see if they can find a way to have these NDAs waived. If you summon documents from the companies, there\'s no liability to the government.MPs want to see documents in an unredacted way. MP: We\'re not going to achieve consensus today on an NDA or no NDA. If we know that there is some risk to the Canadian taxpayer if there\'s a breach, why wouldn\'t we at least try to inform ourselves of exactly what that risk is? MP: Maybe what should happen is that we call the department\'s legal advisers to explain to the committee in an in camera session what they see as the legal risks of not signing the N DA.Liberal MP says committee has an absolute right to documents. He says the easiest way to get documents in an unredacted way without breaching agreement is through this process. \"To say that our non-partisan civil service that enters into agreements and then provides advice as to what the scope of that agreement is is somehow against Canadians, I don\'t think is fair either,\" he says. \"I haven\'t heard anything about a suggestion, a concrete proposal to deal with the concerns that I legitimately have\"',50,'Mr. Anthony Housefather'),

(1031,451453793663981895,'We looked at a group of files, about 20 files, where we saw the custody rating scale being overridden and the indigenous offender being placed in a higher security institution. We saw no evidence of their indigenous social history being considered in those 20 files. There was no documentation of it. That doesn\'t mean it didn\'t happen, but we saw no proof of it happening. That\'s why we recommended that more needs to be done around overrides, but also codifying and solidifying the considering of indigenoussocial history.Audit found Correctional Service Canada had failed to identify and eliminate systemic barriers that persistently disadvantaged certain groups of offenders. The overrepresentation of indigenous and Black offenders in custody had worsened, with higher security classifications, late delivery of correctional programs and delayed access to release on parole. The reliability of CSC\'s custody rating scale for initial security placements had not been validated since 2012, and its use for Black offenders had never been validated at all. CSC committed to building a workforce that reflects the diversity of its offender population, but had not yet established a plan to bridge these representation gaps.',49,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),
(1032,451453793663981897,'We have historically exceeded the workforce availability for indigenous people and visible minorities, but we have more work to do for persons with disabilities.

The other thing though, in terms of more representatives of the population that we serve, we have representation objectives for each institution that take into account the population. Indigenous offenders, as I mentioned when I talked about the profile, have fairly high needs. They require more intensive programming. With indigenous offenders, although the sentences are getting longer, there are also some who are serving shorter sentences.The Correctional Service of Canada has set ambitious targets for Indigenous and visible minority representation within its workforce. In 2021-22, high percentages of indigenous and Black offenders were not readmitted to federal custody within the five years following the end of their sentences. In addition to the measures I just mentioned, we are working to better reflect the diversity of the offender population among the staff who work with them. The Service is also formalizing its goals for gender representation in women\'s facilities. I want to thank all our employees for their ongoing hard dedication and commitment.Last year 35% of CSC admissions were indigenous offenders. The data shows that in terms of gang affiliation, it\'s higher. In terms of representation, 10% of our staff is actually indigenous. We have a national elders working group as well as a national indigenous advisory committee. The other big thing is that we are in the process of hiring a deputy commissioner for indigenous corrections. Hopefully, that will help advance our mandate. The indigenous correctional programs have been developed with indigenous people. Too, there are elders participate in the program to help them so that they can speak.The Correctional Service of Canada has a mandate to help offenders become law-abiding citizens. We are in the midst of a culture change at Correctional Service Canada and we have conducted a culture audit. In institutions with a higher number of Indigenous offenders, we will ensure that there is a representative and diverse staff. We have an MOU with the University of Regina to develop an indigenous-informed, gender-informed security classification process. It\'s a five-year MOU, and we\'re into the third year.I would say it\'s a little bit of both: that we need to. We want to work with them, basically to ensure that they are better when they are released. For indigenous offenders, I just want to say that they do well too. We\'ve seen an improvement. It used to be in the high seventies, but now it\'s 83.5%. We\'re actually reaching out to the community. We have indigenous recruitment officers who go into the community to try to recruit indigenous people.We have a mother-child program that has been in existence for quite some time. Children can stay with their mothers at the institution when they\'re preschool age. We care about ensuring that we offer the offenders who come into our custody what they require so that they don\'t return to custody. We want them to stay in the community. The inmates, depending on their spirituality, get the spiritual adviser they require. We do have 10 healing lodges. We have 654 women right now and we have women\'s facilities.',49,'Ms. Anne Kelly'),

They just said it was a difficult process, because there were so many other countries trying to donate at the same time. We are in the process of doing the ArriveCAN audit, which was requested of us. We recognize that this committee has passed a unanimous motion for us to look at contracting with McKinsey. As an executive team, we\'re figuring out the best way to audit, if it\'s something we can slot in.Audit examined how the federal government procured, authorized, and distributed vaccines to the provinces and territories to immunize Canadians against COVID 19. By the end of May 2022, Canada had 32.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, estimated to be worth about $1 billion, in federal, provincial and territorial inventories. Another 50.6 million doses were deemed surplus and offered for donation. The Public Health Agency of Canada delivered vaccines within two days of receiving a province s or a territory s request. Delays in implementing important functionalities of VaccineConnect reduced the agency\'s ability to track wastage.Vaccine task force made a recommendation in late June about companies that would be viable to have vaccines, but I would hand it over, perhaps, to Mr. Lucas to expand. Public Services and Procurement Canada expedited its procurement process and still followed some elements that we had highlighted earlier on in the personal protective equipment audit. The provinces and territories received doses, on average, within two days of putting a request in to the federal government. There are always two sides to every coin and, obviously, things that needed to be done better.

Deloitte was contracted specifically for VaccineConnect and not in general for the health data component, which was a part of our strategy in the pan-Canadian health data strategy. We actually reached out to multiple countries and offered those surplus vaccines. There were situations where, in addition to Latin America and Caribbean countries, there were African countries that also opted for that. We were diligent enough to send them not only the vaccines but also the supplies needed for the vaccination, to make it possible.Joining me today are Stephen Bent, vice-president of the vaccine rollout task force, and Luc Gagnon, the chief digital transformation officer for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Mr Bent, thank you for the opportunity to appear before this committee. Mr Gagnons, thanks for the chance to talk about access to COVID-19 vaccines. Mr. Bent, I would be happy to respond to questions. Mr Chair, in case you need more on that, we have a bit more that we have to answer.Mr. Chair, I\'ll start by mentioning that we have been very diligent in working with COVAX, an international way of making sure that donations are equitably distributed. Canada, among the G7 countries, had the highest rate of the primary vaccination, and that continues to be the case. As of today, we have 80.7% of primary series coverage as of January 29. We are also among the top two who have delivered booster vaccinations 44% for Japan and 26% for Canada so we are amongst the leaders in terms of early vaccination.',48,'Dr. Harpreet S. Kochhar'),
(1048,451453793663981929,'I\'ll respond initially and then turn to Stephen Bent from the Public Health Agency. Mr. Chair, what I would say just at the outset is that Canada is one of the top donors to COVAX, financially. The contribution to supporting vaccine access in low- and middle-income countries was through financial donations, not only for vaccine purchase. The investments we have made through Global Affairs to support information and support trusted people in communities on vaccine uptake have been important, recognizing some of the challenges in uptake.Health Canada is responsible for regulating health products in Canada, including vaccines. The department evaluates data in support of the safety, quality and efficacy of health products before authorizing them for sale in Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a global threat and public health emergency that required the federal government to act quickly regarding vaccine approval, procurement, distribution and surveillance. Health Canada acknowledges the extensive effort of the Office of the Auditor General, in collaboration with relevant partners across government, in developing the COVID 19 vaccines report.During the pandemic, the Public Health Agency and Health Canada worked extensively with provinces and territories to support and facilitate data information sharing. There are technical barriers in terms of systems being able to connect, but work is advancing on that. The government has invested over $2.1 billion in a biomanufacturing life science strategy. That is invested in establishing all aspects...from vaccine therapeutic production to the fill and finish of the final bottles. That includes an agreement with Moderna to establish a manufacturing facility in Quebec. We are trying to respond quickly, here in Canada, to the threat of a new threat.',48,'Dr. Stephen Lucas'),

In terms of comparing it with other types of vaccine, I\'m afraid I can\'t answer that question. We had an open competition for that, and I think we received several bidders. They were the ones that had the best-value bids.The Government of Canada worked diligently to secure access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. At the time, there was great uncertainty about which vaccines would be developed and authorized. Canada also had very limited domestic capacity to produce vaccines and relied on international products. In July 2021, the government announced that Canada had received more than 66 million doses of COVID 19 vaccines, enough to fully vaccinate every eligible person in Canada and meeting the government s target to provide vaccines to those who wanted them by fall 2021.',48,'Ms. Arianne Reza'),

That is a tough pill to swallow for many Canadians.50.6 million doses waited for donation. Of those, 13.6million had already expired by May 2022. Canada managed to donate 15.3 million doses by the end of 2022. This does leave another 21.7 million doses that were offered by the federal government but were still waiting for donation as of May last year.

(1091,451453793663982015,'The first step is to identify payments to ineligible recipients. Then the decision can be made to go after collection or not collection. The Canada Revenue Agency is in full agreement with both of these recommendations. It is already well ahead of schedule in implementing them. It will be long and difficult, but it will improve the management of a number of benefit programs, and not just those related to emergency situations. It\'s not enough to look at the figures, but we also have to make sure that every taxpayer has been treated fairly.Audit focused on whether Employment and Social Development Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency managed COVID 19 benefits efficiently and effectively. We looked at six programs and found that overpayments of $4.6 billion were made to ineligible individuals. We also estimated that at least $27.4 billion of payments to individuals and employers should be investigated further. The number of post-payment verifications that the department and the agency have planned are insufficient. The federal government has spent billions of dollars and does not know whether that money always went to eligible recipients.There were limited pre-payment controls for some of the wage subsidies. The control I would have liked to see would have been one around revenues. The way the wage subsidy program was designed didn\'t discriminate against a business based on its size or its industry. Every employer was eligible if they saw a revenue decline. The only way you could find out whether or not a business was eligible would be to do that postpayment work, because there was no other information to verify eligibility. There is an issue with almost two out of three files, which is an indicator that you need to do more work.',45,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),
(1092,451453793663982017,'There are advantages to it. There are advantages beyond the CRA, but we have to consult with businesses and think about the structural changes. It will come to what the capacity is at the CRA to do these big structural changes together. I don\'t know if we\'d be able to distinguish between the wage subsidy and the other benefits, but if we can, we will. The only question I\'m asking myself as you ask the question is on quarterly reports. Is enough going to happen in a quarter to justify it as a report?The CRA accepts the majority of the recommendations, partially accepts one and is working to implement them. The results of completed CEWS audits to date suggest that the number of ineligible claims is expected to be significantly lower than initially projected by the Auditor General. The CRA has started its reviews and audits of the highest-risk claimants, allowing the CRA to focus on claims that are most likely to be ineligible or overstated. This approach optimizes recoveries and ensures that high-risk claims are addressed while making efficient use of CRA resources.No. We didn\'t want to commit to reviewing every claim that came in. There is an approach where you could go after 100% and uncover everything. About 6% of complaints that we have had so far have been either adjusted or denied. It is true that there are some restrictions after three or four years, but those don\'t apply in cases where we see fraud or misleading information. In terms of collections, once we establish the debt, we have lots of time to collect. It\'s conceivable that in a certain circumstance you could run out of time.The main reason we can\'t estimate the amount paid to ineligible recipients is that we\'re not far enough into the audit process. I think, as indicated, we were operating in a very time-pressed environment, so maybe there weren\'t as many prepayment controls as we might have on the regular income taxes per se. We have compensated for that by having a little more on the postpayment controls, but there definitely were certainly more than with the CERB prepyment controls before businesses got the money.CRA is trying to change people\'s impressions to see the CRA as being a bit more service-oriented, but that\'s a journey. In auditing, it\'s important to take into account the situation that prevailed during that period. In some cases, businesses are more vulnerable because of the difficulties created by the pandemic. It is not a question of resources. We need to look at the slightly more complex cases of some larger businesses. We\'re examining, as we go, what we see and what it tells us through our business intelligence.Mr. Chair, as part of the wage subsidy, we started the audits quite early, with a pilot project in 2020, and there was some push-back on that. We carried on with it because we thought that even though it was early, it would give us some information we could use down the road. We\'re now into phase two and have a number of audits under way. We have almost $15 billion under audit right now, so, again, to the question of whether we are ignoring it, the answer is no.I don\'t have a degree of discomfort with where we are and where we\'re going. The program is very rigorous in terms of the wage subsidy. It\'s a process that focuses on high-risk applications, but it\'s not a lack of rigour. We think we\'re still learning on the compliance side. We\'re picking up some lessons as we look at companies and assess them things we can do to improve our audit plan. For some programs, such as the emergency wage subsidy, there is a time constraint, but we at CRA believe that we will be able to continue the audits after three or four years, if necessary.Mr. Chair, I don\'t have the figures right in front of me, but I know that they are in the Auditor General\'s report, so she may be able to beat me to the punch on this one. If a company looks like it\'s going to be insolvent, that makes the prospect of collection, should there be a problem, riskier. I think there\'s a lot of work that needs to get done and that we are doing, and probably down the road we\'ll see those differences reduced.',45,'Mr. Bob Hamilton'),
(1093,451453793663982019,'Of the wage subsidy in the CEWS, $32 billion has been identified as potentially having gone to ineligible recipients. That doesn\'t include money that went to eligible recipients whom many would deem unworthy. There was about $10 billion paid to students to not work when the economy opened up in the summer of 2021. If you add those amounts together, then we\'re talking about almost $50 billion. That could be anywhere between 20% to 25%. That\'s why this is an important discussion to have. Canadians deserve follow-up information from the Canada Revenue Agency.Mr. Hamilton, it\'s been about 15 years since we crossed paths at the Department of Finance.

The Auditor General has outlined a methodology that seems to be rather reasonable. Are you confident that you\'re going to be able to complete the ones that you want to within a legislated timeline? Would you have time to investigate the $15 billion?',45,'Mr. Adam Chambers'),

A former governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, is on record as saying that had it not been for the emergency programs, Canada would have seen a situation approximating a depression. Would you agree or disagree with that?

Minister of National Revenue\'s comments contradicted the figures that had been developed, studied and then presented by the Auditor General. The question here is quantitative, not qualitative, so there is no room for interpretation. The criteria are strict.

I am very pleased to see that in many ways this benefit, the Canadian emergency wage subsidy, and other benefits for COVID-19 were able to help people. When asked for assistance during one of our country\'s greatest times of need, the CRA did, in fact, do its job and did it well. The hard work of the civil service workers, with their skill and dedication to delivering this relief, is the reason Canadians got it.The Canadian emergency wage subsidy has, in fact, been used by companies to attack workers in the middle of a labour dispute. This was most evident in my community here in Edmonton, where a large corporation known as Cessco, a manufacturing company, received the wage subsidy while also locking out their 40-year, long-time employees.

Thank you very much, and we appreciate your feedback on the lock-up.I will start with our audit on COVID 19 vaccines. We found that the Public Health Agency of Canada\'s efforts to minimize wastage were unsuccessful. Long-standing issues remain with respect to sharing of data.There was no information gathered, such as the social insurance numbers of employees, in order to be able to know if that relationship was maintained. We\'ve identified all of those, we believe, in our testing, and have made that information available to the Canada Revenue Agency. The approach to limit prepayment controls was one that is seen as an international best practice in the time of an emergency. But that comes hand in hand with needing to do rigorous post-payment verification to confirm eligibility and take the necessary steps afterwards.A post-payment verification audit for a business will be much more lengthy. A different approach is likely needed for businesses and individuals. The Canada Revenue Agency disagreed with our recommendations to follow up on all individuals and businesses that had a high risk indicator of being ineligible for the payments. We put this in the pool of amounts received that the government should be tracking. No one individual influences our work. We decide what we do. We would never issue a report if we were not completely sure of our findings.There wasn\'t rigorous prepayment vetting. I didn\'t say that every single transaction to a Canadian or a business should be investigated. There are many individuals and businesses that received support they were eligible for. It is the bucket where we have these high risk indicators that requires more work. I would recommend that an agreement be reached to determine the type of data that can be shared.

The 2030 emissions reduction plan, for example, which was released at the end of March of this year, references a number of hydrogen-related initiatives. The Government of Canada is also supporting the production and use of clean hydrogen through the support of projects funded under the net-zero accelerator initiative.The strengthened climate plan and the emissions reduction plan that followed suit in March are extremely comprehensive. They are products of a lot of detailed work done internally within departments and then worked up collectively in a whole-of-government way across. The specific work that happens on the modelling and the individual data that\'s collected is typically handled at the officials level. The Bay du Nord project is one that I\'m familiar with.

(1122,451453793663982077,'Our intention through the hydrogen strategy was to create a call to action, which was to show the potential of this area of energy generation. This was something that was a product of analysis that was done, as my colleague mentioned, through a series of consultations with experts. We continue to do that consultation. That\'s one of the reasons why we are committed to a progress report, which will further refine the picture that we have been painting with respect to the future of hydrogen. I\'ll turn to my colleague on this one.I am also honoured to be joining the committee from the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people. Mr. Chair, the commissioner\'s report highlighted hydrogen\'s essential role in our future, and my department fully agrees. Global urgency on energy security, the energy transition, and the climate imperative have cemented hydrogen\'s critical role in meeting domestic and global energy needs. This urgency plus Canada\'s climate commitments make Canada a partner of choice to supply clean hydrogen. The government is committed to unlocking hydrogen\'s potential to ensure Canada\'s economic and climate success.There is an increasing demand for hydrogen as a clean fuel that we are seeing in a number of different ways. The technology to create clean hydrogen which is very low-carbon from natural gas has advanced dramatically over the course of the last period of time. We are taking very substantial steps to address the emissions, which are just an aspect of our economy and society. The emissions reduction plan that was released in the spring is among the most ambitious and most detailed internationally. As we think about the investments we\'re making through the mechanisms I mentioned earlier, we have an opportunity to make inroads for Canada.Hydrogen has the potential of being a very significant part of that mix. I think various parts of the country are going to have various advantages with respect to hydrogen. In Quebec, where there is the possible generation of hydrogen through clean electricity and the separation of water molecules, one of the benefits of hydrogen is as a means of transporting electricity effectively. There is currently the potential to move hydrogen, to some degree. You can blend hydrogen with other gases and it can be moved through existing infrastructure at relatively low ratios.Natural Resources Canada has been making substantial investments in hydrogen technology. We have an arrangement with the Germans, which is a structured conversation precisely to determine what that market will look like. There are current applications once one has created the hydrogen that exists right now, and that includes transportation. We are working on identification of shared priorities in order to then go to the next stage of the conversation. We\'re on track for the next progress report next year, I believe it\'s March. Is that right? I think that\'s probably for me.Mr. Chair, the intention of the report was to show the full potential. We have taken a series of tangible steps over the course of the last several years, including significant investments in the production of hydrogen through natural gas sources. We are also making investments with respect to the infrastructure, because that\'s obviously a critical enabler here. It\'s partially a question of investments in technology, then, one of the applications here would be to take, say, wind onshore or offshore wind on the east coast.',42,'Mr. John Hannaford'),

We\'re looking at that as a way to automate and have more efficient and timely capturing of shelter data information across the nation.

We are committed to continuing our work with other departments and other governments and with the not-for-profit sector, to support the most vulnerable Canadians across the country.

The government has continued to increase its support for the homeless at that level until the end of 2025.The government doubled its support for Reaching Home during the COVID time period.

It is to give communities funds so they can deliver services to people who need help to find housing or temporary financial support for housing.

It breaks my heart to know this is the case, not just for Tristan but thousands of people across the country. This has real-life consequences.',38,'Mr. Blake Desjarlais'),

I\'m just not sure if that iteration is out in public yet or if it\'s coming.Maybe I could get back to the committee with that, if you\'d like. I just don\'t remember where it is in that process.In March 2021, our office received $25 million of additional permanent funding. With this new funding, we hired additional staff and now employ almost 800 persons. We also increased the number of performance audits we produce in a year, from an average of 14 before receiving an increase in our funding to more than 20 in the 2022-23 fiscal year. In our view, it is important that a long-term, stable funding mechanism be established to preserve our independence and our capacity to respond to an evolving environment.The lack of funding has affected our ability to deliver the volume of work that Parliament expected from us. We prioritized work included in legislation the work we do on the Public Accounts of Canada, on the public accounts of the territories, and all the financial audits that are legislated in acts. It\'s difficult, for sure, if we issue an opinion or complete an audit that doesn\'t have positive results on one of the central agencies. I think there should be objectivity in establishing funding levels, and I see Parliament this committee, perhaps, or another committee playing a real and active role.The Auditor General Act sets out that I can set the terms and conditions for all employees who work for my office, except when they are represented by a bargaining agent. That mandate is similar to the mandate any other department would receive. The government must decide whether it wants Crown corporations to provide more information to the public. A museum is currently undergoing exactly the same special examination as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The latter is a large organization compared to a museum, which has 100 or fewer employees. It would help if we had a little more flexibility.An audit isn\'t one size fits all for many reasons. As government spending goes up, there is a need for us to have more capacity to do more work or there will be work we have to not do in order to cover new programs. There might be elements that are difficult to report because of national security or the sensitive nature of the information. There are many reasons that might cause one audit to take a little bit longer than another. I believe the audit you\'re referring to is the one in Bill C-2, which was one look at post-payment work for different COVID relief programs.',36,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

I think the message here is that we have more planning to do to identify more actions to get us there. I\'m thinking of more energy refits of buildings and the things we\'ve already talked about today in terms of getting there.The Department of National Defence has some work to do before finalizing its plans to reach its emissions targets for 2050. We have 25 years to reach the 2050 targets, and we are currently on track. With additional resources, we\'ve identified up to 83%. That leaves a gap, so we still have some Work to do. There\'s no doubt that our operational activity was reduced during the pandemic. Of course, that had an impact. We believe it led to a 7% reduction in emissions. We still have work ahead of us.The military and the air force would obviously need planes to fly, and so I don\'t view grounding fleets as an option on that front. It\'s more a question back to industry; that is, what can you do to make your products greener as time goes on? If we are still burning those fossils fuels, then it\'s the same answer: we have the credits option. At every base and wing we\'ve put in an energy manager.

Not every element of that pathway has been nailed down yet, but it\'s changing in the right direction every year. I would say, like DND, that we have not figured out every last change to get us to net- zero 2050, but the rate of progress and evolution of the carbon-neutral road map is such that I think we\'re on a pathway to get ourselves there.Transport Canada\'s carbon footprint is much smaller than DND\'s. In Transport the vast majority actually comes from the transportation fleet. One of the key strategies to achieve the targets is actually switching to lower-carbon fuels. There are some very promising developments in broader industry with respect to the development of low- carbon fuels but that also represents a risk.

These individuals include low-income members of groups who are not easily served through regular channels, such as Indigenous people, seniors, newcomers to Canada, and people with disabilities.

There are many benefits out there.

Over the 2017 to 2020 period, there has been a roughly 7% increase in individuals who have accessed the CRA s CVITP. The number of tax returns filed has increased by over 11%, and the number of individuals who were assisted during outreach sessions has increase by over 15%. The CRA is making it easier for individuals, especially those from at-risk populations, to access important benefits and credits.Mr. Gutete: The community volunteer income tax program is a very important one that we\'ve worked on quite aggressively over the last number of years. It\'s a way for us to get into the communities and try to help the people within those communities, with the support of others. We\'re looking at improving financial and tax literacy through educational efforts that we provide. We are raising that awareness so that people recognize that filing their taxes is an important key to enabling some of the benefits to come through.Mr. Garnett: We\'re trying to make that process as easy as possible for people. A million or so people use paper forms, and we mail the forms out to them to make it easier. We are doing the best we can. The system works better when it\'s as simple as possible to navigate. Mr. Gu nette: We are not able, at the moment, to collect information on, for example, the people who get helped by the CVITP. We face privacy laws, as does every other organization.I would have to go back and review the departmental plan the corporate business plan I think you\'re referring to, but it certainly has been a priority. We did some work with Statistics Canada and ESDC to try to use that statistical method to estimate take-up rates of the child benefit in indigenous communities.

We need to access the services that are already on the ground doing a lot of this work and that know those people.Audit s main finding was that the government did not have a clear and complete picture of the people who were not receiving benefits to which they may be entitled. Service Canada introduced the reaching all Canadians initiative, which is specifically designed to increase benefit uptake and eliminate barriers to access and delivery. In April 2020, we launched the Outreach Support Centre to provide immediate, direct and personalized toll-free phone service to Indigenous communities. Last year, the support centre received over 27,000 calls and provided nearly 32,000 services to hard-to-reach Canadians.Service Canada is using third party resources, such as NGOs or advocacy and help groups that are on the ground and accessing these people. We are in the process of finalizing retraining to all of our outreach centres, where people are still looking for us to join them. We do consultation and outreach in urban centres very frequently across the country. We\'re very motivated by the Auditor General\'s recommendation to share data with Stats Canada.

Since the summer of 2022, we have been working together to identify governance for the joint program and discuss strategies to develop performance measures. Statistics Canada\'s actions cannot include the sharing of confidential microdata.

We found that veterans were waiting almost 10 months for a decision on a first application, which is much longer than the department s service standard.

Since the audit period ended, in September 2021, the department has made some real, tangible progress, most notably reducing the backlog by 41%. The backlog is the number of applications over the service standard. Our service standard is 16 weeks, 80% of the time. As of September 29, 2022, 9,687 applications were over theService standard of the total 30,725 pending. We know that these numbers are still too high, but it\'s a significant improvement from where they used to be.A member of the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs asked a similar question. We have seen a spike, a really large increase, in the number of applications coming forward from former RCMP members. As I indicated in my opening comments, one issue we have addressed, which has been in place since the beginning of this fiscal year, April 1, is the calculation of the time. That has been effective and is already at play. We\'ve already cut wait times for francophone applicants by nearly 10 weeks. We still have a long way to go, but we are committed to correcting the situation.Mr. Chair, productivity hasn\'t dropped.

The plan has remained overall at $188 billion, and that is what we\'re tracking for the investing in Canada plan. There has been, in a number of departments, investments in infrastructure post the plan, post-budget 2017.

A key component of reconciliation is eliminating long term drinking water advisories on public water systems on first nations reserves and addressing community infrastructure needs. Indigenous Services Canada\'s efforts had been constrained by an outdated policy and formula for funding the operation and maintenance of public water system. The department had not amended the funding formula since it was first developed 30 years ago. Until the formula is updated, it is unclear whether funding increases will be sufficient to meet first nations\' water Infrastructure needs.',25,'Ms. Karen Hogan'),

It\'s really going to take control over water services for those communities that want to work through the authority. The hubs are having an impact in terms of the ability to transform the service. Do we want to look at hubs across the country? Yes, but it\'s got to work for what\'s right in communities.I am pleased to give an update on the department\'s progress regarding the recommendations made by the Auditor General in Report 3, Access to Safe Drinking Water in First Nations Communities. The department continues to work with and support first nations as the owners and operators of their water systems to address all remaining long term drinking water advisories as soon as possible. Since 2016, the Government of Canada has committed over $5.6 billion to upgrade water and waste-water infrastructure on first nations reserves. We will continue to proactively work with communities to prevent recurring advisories.Since 2015, 132 long-term drinking water advisories have been lifted and 219 were also lifted before they became long term. I think we are seeing some progress, but there is a lot of work left to do. A lot of operation and capacity needs exist in communities now. There are huge trust issues with the government and communities with respect to water, and rightfully so, after all these years. We are starting to see the benefits of investments, but I do believe it will take a number of years.The department is investing in water authorities, water hubs and community tribal councils that are running the water services for communities. We have a commitment to codevelop with first nations partners, and we have started that. The challenges remain. I don\'t want to give the impression that there\'s still not work to be done, and it\'s work which we will continue. As of July 2021, we have updated our formula and that we are making progress. We can now tell you how much money the department has set aside for first nations. A certain portion of our funding is allocated from year to year.There is a commitment to get all 34 remaining long-term drinking advisories lifted. 88% of those remaining are in either the construction or the final completion stage of the advisories that remain. Only a few are in that first kind of feasibility or design stage. It\'s 88% but I cannot give you today a date on every single one because we\'re still working with the communities to determine the final lift date. I would also say that, at the end of the day, it is the community that decides on the lift, not the government.I would just note to the chair that the department is taking this.... I know actions speak louder than any commitments that can be made, but there is action there. We have done a lot of work on infrastructure plans, which aren\'t just related to drinking water. We\'ve implemented an action plan for each community based on their infrastructure priorities. There\'s information on the website. We can certainly provide documentation on the results in education, health centres, and housing. This information is updated very regularly. It\'s a complex issue, and I think that, depending on the health of the community, that\'s also a consideration.I would say that, when I look down the list of every single water advisory that is left, I see that sometimes it\'s a trucking issue, sometimes a sewer plant issue. Right now, we have a huge issue with labour availability and even some of the parts required for construction. We hope that these changes will bring that certainty and predictability of funding. We are seeing progress by 132 lifts and by the connections to systems that weren\'t there previously. We\'re talking to first nations leadership about the production of that because bad actors and bad contractors are in place.I think some common factors among some of the communities include remoteness, a shortened construction season and sometimes the complexity of where we\'re building. I think we definitely try to do lessons learned as we work with one community, and maybe one solution can be shared. In the 29 communities that are still impacted by long-term drinking water advisories, we have data on each community.

It\'s not, because the demand is still there. When Canada does A, country B could come in and fill in the gap.The tone and the status quo of what I\'m hearing here is about discontinuing. The commissioner referenced that the legislation to support workers was not available. It was supposed to be tabled in the fall. The one thing that was missing, in the comments you made today, was an actual timeline of when the legislation is going to be ready. I do think living in denial amounts to two things.

My reports also include copies of the special examination of Farm Credit Canada and the Federal Bridge Corporation Limited. For us, the story is too often familiar over years of auditing, we report slow progress and results that are stagnant or worsening. In many programs and departments, it seems that too often people run into barriers when accessing programs and services they are entitled to. As I near the third year of my mandate, I\'m feeling more frustrated than hopeful.Our third audit focused on the processing of disability benefit claims for veterans from the Canadian Armed Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Overall, we found that veterans waited almost 10 months for a decision when first applying for benefits. Processing timelines were longer for francophones, women and RCMP veterans. In many cases, the analysis had been completed, but we did not see a concrete impact on outcomes. The federal government must do better. All of Canada\'s people, no matter their gender, race, ability or geographical location, deserve better much better.Auditor General: It\'s about having data, having a good data strategy and knowing what you have, but then using it in a meaningful way. I am pleased to see an increased dialogue and awareness, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, about gender and other identity factors. Dialogue is a great place to start, but it\'s just the first step. Let\'s not focus on process but focus on the progress of programs, he says. It\'s not about only a new program but perhaps applying it to existing programs.I think that if the attention we saw, the shift that we saw during the pandemic to really focus in on outcomes, is applied with a GBA+ lens, it would hopefully drive some meaningful change. What I find all too often happens, and these reports are examples of that, is that there is a lot of focus on the machinery, on the process, instead of the outcome. It\'s almost like too much attention is put to all the steps to get somewhere and we forget about where we were going. The federal government is excellent at creating an action plan, but it\'s the actual implementation of that action plan.I would hope that they started to act on our findings, even while we were auditing. I would like to think that there has been some improvement. There are many ways that the department would be subject to follow up. The focus of the follow-ups should really be on improved outcomes and not just on whether or not processes were changed or modified. It is very important to change this cycle of temporary measures or measures whose progress is slow. That is why I said that, after only two years, I am more frustrated.Mr. Swales: I believe what we\'re not seeing is a focus on the actual barrier that needs to be addressed. We\'re really seeing the focus on having the hard-to-reach populations understand that this is the traditional access point to get these benefits. In many instances there is a need to provide permanent funding to provide Veterans Affairs Canada so that they have a long-term stable workforce. In the case of access to safe drinking water, it\'s likely that there\'s more funding needed.I\'ll start, and then, if I may, Madam Chair, I\'ll see if Mr. Swales would like to add to that. To return to a statement I made earlier, it isn\'t just about the process. It\'s about the outcome, and that, to me, is a way to spend more effectively. I think it\'s about acknowledging that you now need to actually touch the edges. The most vulnerable are those who really need the programs the most. We must be able to determine, for instance how a woman can access a program or not.A lot of the outreach actually didn\'t have that sort of hands-on, tailored approach for an individual who might be experiencing multiple barriers in order to access the program. I believe that\'s one area that we highlighted in our report on hard-to-reach people where there\'s a large opportunity for improvement. The focus, again, shouldn\'t just be on the process. Adding value is looking at the outcomes for individuals, such as actually accessing the benefits.

It is clear we see it even within the public service pension plan that there\'s an intergenerational issue. We didn\'t list the names of the organizations in order to not further expose them to any risks or vulnerabilities, but two of them have been very public in the media. The knowledge about what personal information might have been compromised is already out in the public domain in those two instances.This year, our audit of the government\'s financial statements involved most of our 200 financial auditors. We found that you can rely on the information contained in the financial statements. For pay administration, we once again carried out detailed audit tests of salary transactions processed through the Phoenix pay system. Almost half of the employees in our sample were paid incorrectly at least once during the 2020-21 fiscal year. We did not see an overall improvement in the rate of errors in our sampling. In our view, errors in reported quantities and values are likely to continue until internal controls are strengthened.Auditor General: Government of Canada\'s financial statements have not had a double dating before since accrual accounting. The decision to reopen the financial statements once they\'ve been signed off is not one for me to make, he says. \"The financial statements is the accounting of how you actually spend taxpayers\' money,\" he adds. \"I will likely ask Etienne or Chantale to add a little about the outstanding pay action requests. There will always be requests in the system to have adjustments to pay\"I think there are a few reasons behind why this hasn\'t been remedied. The federal government is sort of a pay behind , right? We pay a few weeks later, whereas the system is more real time. As soon as you have a real-time adjustment that\'s not reflected in a timely way, there could be a possibility to have an error in pay.

We had an event and it gave us information that we felt would put us in a better position to revalue and re-estimate potential liability. There was no Parliament to table it into. The Parliament reconvened on November 19, if I\'m not mistaken. I don\'t know what the Auditor General would have done, but there was a chance that the books would have been qualified, so again.

There are and there will be processes to correct situations where individuals may have received certain amounts in error. We are working with our colleagues as quickly as possible. The speed with which Canada is returning to prepandemic paths particularly with respect to the deficit outlook is among the very fastest of the G7. The IMF\'s comparisons that they do across countries, Canada on a debt-to-GDP basis has the most favourable debt- To GDP ratio of any G7 country.Mr. Chair, even if you look at this on a gross basis, Canada ranks either second or third in the G7.

Over time, as the world evolves towards a net-zero world and obviously that\'s a world headed toward 2050, there\'s a substantial period of time between now and then as you say.

It was based on needs from different organizations, not being prescriptive about who we thought had needs and who didn\'t, he says. It\'s quite different, though, from an emergency relief project, which is what the R RRF was.Southern Ontario is a key driver of Canada\'s economic growth, representing more than 39% of the country\'s GDP and employment. The region was hard hit by the pandemic. More than a million jobs were lost in southern Ontario by April 2020. To provide critical support to small businesses and their employees when it was needed most, FedDev Ontario was allocated more than $500 million to deliver the RRRF. The Auditor General\'s report noted that overall, the R RRF was successful at providing last-resort assistance to thousands of businesses.I think there were a few one-off discrepancies in that regard, but I think there\'s a multi-stage process for reassessing those job numbers. In many of the circumstances for the companies, we were the lender of last resort within the federal frame of supports. We were able to provide funding tailored to specific needs and circumstances where a company may have been more impacted than another. The digital main street program worked directly with communities and with main street businesses to help get them online with small grants of $2,500.It\'s really hard to make comparisons between each of the regions. Even within southern Ontario, we have very different impacts from the pandemic. We were able to support 39,000 different SMEs across the region with that host of activities.

There is so much uniqueness with every country that you need to factor in, and you also have the rate of people being vaccinated, so it\'s a nuance.The Public Health Agency of Canada did not adequately administer two new border control measures introduced in early 2021 to respond to the risk of variants entering Canada. Incoming travellers were required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival, followed by a second test eight days later. The agency was either missing or unable to match 30% of test results to travellers between February and June of 2021. Even more concerning was that the agency never contacted more than 1,000 travellers who tested positive to inform them of their test results and related isolation requirements.We observed improved practices for contacting travellers. However, the agency did not learn lessons and automate the process to improve data collection. There was insufficient data to determine whether the measures were effective and whether they needed to be adjusted during the pandemic.

We also established a compassionate exemption program. This allows travellers who would otherwise be prohibited from entering Canada to attend funerals and provide care or support to critically ill persons.We also had the Canada border testing program, which we talked about, through which we were doing surveillance to see how many travellers were coming in.I\'ll start, and maybe Brigitte or Jennifer can pitch in on the aspect of where we are. What we are talking about is in terms of the Auditor General looking at a whole spectrum of how many of those positives, which we could not tally, were actually contacted.

We are exploring other options that we could put in place so that we are better equipped and have more tools.Public Health Agency verifies travel compliance with emergency orders through live calls with screening officers and automated interactive voice calls. Travellers who have an indication of non-compliance are referred to the appropriate police of jurisdiction. Mandatory random testing at the airports is more often a way to allow us later to screen those at highest risk, coming from countries that have a higher incidence of COVID-19.

We look at the numbers to see what we can actually do to improve the situation. I\'m pleased to say that we have numbers that are higher than what the labour availability is telling us, but that\'s not enough.Mr. Chair, I want to begin by acknowledging that I am speaking to you today from the unceded territory of the Anishinabe Algonquin nation of Canada. Thank you for the invitation to appear before the committee today to discuss the Auditor General s report. Employment and Social Development Canada, or ESDC, understands the importance of this audit and agrees with its recommendations. The challenges brought on by COVID 19 have been unprecedented and its impact on the temporary foreign worker program cannot be overstated.During the pandemic, on one hand, we doubled the number of inspectors, but on the other, we were losing 30% of our inspectors and employees annually. That is why I said we were building and flying the plane at the same time. Much of the training is delivered in house. We also have a lot of sessions with the private sector, with the employers. More than 1,100 participated over the last year, which represented more than 200,000 employers. We are trying to make sure that we actually have a solution to the accommodation situation.Inspectors had to double the number of people to deal with the pandemic. They had to go virtual, and the guides were developed at the last minute. It\'s really hard to get the person who made the mistake, when the person didn\'t have the time to develop the training. People who come to Canada expect to be treated like other Canadians and other workers, and should be treated that way. The failure that happened with this program is something that clearly needs to be addressed.The department has been working on benefits night and day since the pandemic. We have increased the resources significantly to make sure that we are able to tackle some of those issues. There is systemic racism in the public service at different levels. It is preoccupation for the senior management. We\'re coming with actions and we will continue to work on this issue. It\'s a legitimate question, which we take very seriously. We are actually coming with facts and we\'re not just making commitments, we\'re actually making commitments.',12,'Mr. Jean-Fran ois Tremblay'),
(1411,451453793663982655,'I\'ll start with the Auditor General. Did you run into any such situations?I\'ll extend that question to ESDC. As you administer the program, have you ran into similar situations?. Do you have a coordinating mechanism with the proper provincial authority?. We often find in the press disturbing images of housing situations. Quite often those are traced back to labour contractors. That also crosses over into provincial labour jurisdiction. That brings in the federal CBSA. That Bringing in the provincial department of labour, and all those situations.I\'m appreciative that the report reinforces that agricultural temporary foreign workers are an integral part of the workforce that supports Canada\'s food system. I wish the report would more strongly acknowledge the existing oversight by municipal and provincial agencies, but overall, it is scathing in its evaluation of the performance of the department. In numerous places, such as paragraphs 13.24 to 13.29, evidence of poor documentation of audits is reported. In December 2020, you took the rather unusual step of meeting with the deputy minister and senior department officials to discuss the seriousness of these early audit findings.',12,'Mr. Dave Epp'),
(1412,451453793663982657,'I\'ll be quick. The inspectors are not allowed to go on site until the workers have arrived in Canada. That is part of the authorities and the ways in which we can do this work. It\'s not to say there isn\'t significant work and progress that needs to be made in order to get to a better place. We are seeing improvements in the last six months, both by way of documentation quality and the timeliness of our inspections. I\'ll concentrate on the supplemental training that we have already put in place to address those pieces.I\'m pleased to report that every effort has been made to address the non-compliance of employers in this regard. Over the two-year period, we identified more than 330 employers who were in contravention. We were pleased to see that 30% of employers were brought into compliance and therefore did not need to go through the monetary penalty or the consideration of a ban. I\'d also like to underscore at this time that part of the impact of wanting to ensure the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers is measured by how many employers we bring into compliance.',12,'Ms. Mary Crescenzi'),

I want to know if there is specific training for those inspectors who will be working in the agricultural sector. There\'s incoherence in the response depending on whom the employer is dealing with. I think that it\'s necessary to look at this matter. These inspections aren\'t just about health. They also include all the documents and the labour market analysis, meaning the initial priorities for the program 10 or 15 years ago.',12,'Mrs. Brenda Shanahan'),

The response, as well as the work plan of Health Canada, will go at least partway to addressing some of those concerns. We need Health Canada to guarantee the safety of these products. There\'s no indication that the risks from natural health products are 1/1000th as important as those from over-the-counter medications. There does need to be a revisiting of that.Canada began regulating natural health products in 2004. Health Canada considers a natural health product to be safe when the product s benefits outweigh the risks, so long as it is used as intended. The audit found that 88% of the products we examined carried potentially misleading information, including health claims that were not authorized by Health Canada. In nearly half of its inspections, the department took regulatory action in response to health risks. The department temporarily waived compliance with the specific regulatory requirements to afford Canadian manufacturers some flexibility without increasing the risk of serious safety concerns.',10,'Mr. Jerry V. DeMarco'),

We\'re certainly committed to keeping the committee updated as needed on our progress in addressing these important findings and recommendations.With the chair\'s recognition of my schedule, I will sign off at this point and thank the committee very much for the opportunity to appear on this topic.Natural health products are used by Canadians daily to care for themselves and their families. They include vitamin supplements, minerals, probiotics, herbal remedies, homeopathic products and traditional products, such as traditional Chinese medicines. In Canada, these products are regulated under the Food and Drugs Act and the Natural Health Products Regulations. The audit found that Health Canada licensed products appropriately, based on evidence of safety and efficacy. It also found that, when an issue was brought to Health Canada s attention, immediate action was taken.One of the recommendations in the audit and an area that Health Canada has been working to address is to strengthen our powers for mandatory recall, mandatory labelling changes and increased fines. These were not included in Vanessa\'s Law, which was passed in 2014, and we are working to have those included. For products, such as traditional medicine, where a community or indigenous group harvests and uses them and are not for sale, they would not be subject to regulation.

(1424,451453793663982681,'In 2020, the number would have been 23 inspections. In terms of a standardized set of regulations, what I would use as the comparator which is almost a gold standard in the drug world are the good manufacturing practices we have. There is a large community of countries in the world that follow the same standard practice, and that has allowed us to rely on mutual recognition quite heavily. The ideal outcome would be that we get to a place, including with a pro-active inspection program, that lets us make use of mutual recognition agreements that also include NHPs.The minister says the first step when an issue comes to our attention is to mitigate risk. Since March 2021 we have been and are now in the middle of a successful project piloting proactive inspections. In the interim, with the one-year pilot that we are soon concluding, between that pilot\'s ending and our assessing the output and consulting with stakeholders, that does not mean that inspection activity will stop. Inspections will continue. We will continue with the momentum that we built up over the last number of years, so there will not be a period.I would like to say, to use the member\'s terms and to support what the Auditor General said, that we do find those concerning. It is not at all unusual to make observations during any kind of inspection. In the vast majority of inspections, there would be observations. However, when they are of the nature of the sample that the member cited, then that is when, from a compliance and enforcement perspective, you are at the top level of addressing that. I\'m assuming that the issue we\'re talking about is addressing the most serious observations that were cited during inspections.',10,'Ms. Linsey Hollett'),

We intend to publish a notice in the Canada Gazette Part II this spring.Thank you for the question. I can start off and perhaps my colleague Linsey can add in anything she wishes. There are a number of recommendations in the report and we have agreed with all five of them. We recognize that there is an abundance of choice, when it comes to what we call self-care products. Knowing which product to purchase for oneself and one\'s family can be challenging. In an effort to provide better support, we are proposing the changes to improve natural health product labels so that they\'re clear and legible.Thank you for the excellent question.

However, we did see evidence in the files of consultation by the department, phone calls and Zoom calls, etc., which isn\'t as useful in the grand scheme of things when you can visit.Audit focused on whether Indigenous Services Canada provided personal protective equipment, nurses and paramedics to meet the needs of indigenous communities and organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we found that the department adapted quickly to respond to the pandemic, but we found a number of weaknesses in the way the department managed its own stockpile. The department did not have complete and accurate data on the stockpile\'s contents. We didn\'t comment on the expiry dates.

(1436,451453793663982705,'I do think that virtual care is an area we absolutely have to look into. There are really innovative robotics technologies when it comes to virtual care in the north. In some of the nursing stations, we\'ve also been able to add equipment like X-ray machines, which in the past weren\'t there. I reach out from time to time directly to a nurse, after either an incident or a challenging situation. I make sure to visit our nurses in communities so that I can hear from them about what goes well and what doesn\'t go so well.Auditor General made two overall recommendations. The first was concerning personal protective equipment. The second concerned the shortage of nurses and paramedics. The department agreed with that recommendation and is now collaborating with the 50 first nations communities that we serve directly and the 29 communities that are managing their own nursing stations. Since April 2021, there have been over 11,000 service days of surge supports provided to help maintain essential clinical services in remote communities. We\'re making improvements in areas such as customized nurse supports to resolve frontline issues related to IT, compensation and security.In the pandemic we saw an increased demand for surge support. We had to think about what some of the creative ways were we could attract and retain. We were able to fly over 5,400 health human resources in and out of those 51 communities. We also instituted ISC CARE, which was turned around in about two weeks. Over 20 million units of PPE have been shipped. At this stage, 2,201 have been delivered. I think we\'re in a much better position than we were pre-pandemic.In 2014, the department relied exclusively on equipment from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Now, a monthly review is done to determine what articles are in stock and what their expiry date is. A test will be done before the end of the fiscal year, and we will begin soon. Everything we do is in partnership with indigenous leadership across this country. We have indigenous leadership on the interview board, so it is absolutely something that we take on board. It is part of our talent acquisition and management. We do that even for our senior executive team.I think the strategy and the engagement has to be not just about what they need in terms of primary health care needs, but it also needs to be future looking. What does the health infrastructure in the community look like? What is the path towards the talent development? The department has emphasized health transformation, and that is about empowering communities to take on the health services for their communities. The department is really trying to resolve the housing shortage issue. I think we have invested just under $1 billion in that initiative since 2015.Emergency management in Canada is not just exclusive to a health pandemic. Data, capacity and governance are key to supporting indigenous leadership in this country. I think housing is a key determinant of health so we have to focus on these things. I would also speak to the potential for health transformation and service transformation and empowering communities by having funds to allow them to take over those services. The idea of having surge teams that can be mobile and move to a crisis or be needs-based could be a really interesting way to meet some needs.The housing challenge and overcrowding had an impact throughout COVID-19. Overcrowding does present huge challenges for health. We really try to take an all-of-community approach to the PPE. We have ongoing conversations with the MNC and the MMF. We did a lot of work with the tis settlements during the pandemic, as opposed to have not consulted directly with them. I spoke to Treaty 8 two nights ago. I spent a couple of hours with them, because they did not feel that we should be engaging broadly on health legislation.Northern Manitoba and Ontario were probably our most challenged communities in terms of the outbreak. There were communities like Norway House, Shamattawa or Red Sucker Lake that seemed to be in a continuous mode of outbreak. They likely received more PPE as a result of the outbreaks and the needs within the community. Many of those communities also made requests for assistance, so the military was sent in. It\'s actually something that\'s still ongoing in some parts of the country, specifically for the Sioux Lookout First Nations Health Authority communities.',8,'Ms. Christiane Fox'),

Do you have a breakdown of what you\'ve found most successful so far? I don\'t think it\'s a lack of effort by the department or indigenous communities to attract staff. The reason I\'m asking is this: What more can we do that the federal government is not doing already to bridge that gap?

We have considered first nations as our brethren since 1603, since the Grande Tabagie de Tadoussac, when an alliance was established.

In the current mix, especially in Ontario and some other jurisdictions around the world, nuclear is a major part of a low-emissions grid. I foresee that continuing at least in the short-term. It should be relatively easy to increase collaboration, especially within the federal government, and not to have, for example, Environment and Climate Change Canada pushing on one side of the rock.Auditor General of Canada: Stronger leadership and coordination are needed to drive progress on climate change. Report sets out eight lessons learned from Canada\'s action and inaction on the enduring climate crisis. There is a need for the federal government to achieve real outcomes, not just words on paper or unfulfilled promises. Like pandemics, climate change is a global crisis, one that experts have been raising the alarm about for decades. Pandemics and climate change both carry risks to human health and the economy, and both require whole-of-society responses.The current government has committed to eliminating fossil fuel subsidies. It remains to be seen what percentage of our energy mix will be provided by nuclear between now and 2030, and then between 2030 and 2050 in terms of the next two targets. We need to change our decision-making structures so that the long-term future, our children and their grandchildren, are not discounted in present-day decision- making. The committee is willing to expand its view and look at issues that traditionally have been seen as environment and sustainable development, separate from social and economic.Greenhouse gases cannot continue to put us in an environmental debt. We have to have that carbon budgeting approach to greenhouse gases like we do with monetary and fiscal issues. The Government of Canada has a critical role, working with the provinces, territories, municipalities and indigenous communities. The solutions are dispersed across all levels of government, communities and people. It\'s whether our generation will listen to the solutions that are out there for us to find. The communities are the ones that experience it. They should have a strong say in how we address it. We\'re going to be transitioning one way or the other.The average Canadian now understands the problems with climate change. It\'s taken years of inaction at the Canadian and global levels to reach the point where we\'re seeing the tangible effects. Canada needs to do a better job in not only coming up with plans but also disclosing the basis, assumptions and modelling for them, he says. \"We owe it to future generations, to our children and our grandchildren, to do what we can rather than just throw up our hands and say it\'s too difficult\"I don\'t have that number off the top of my head, but I would say that having a carbon levy or pricing carbon is consistent with the principles of cost internalization and polluter pays. The Supreme Court of Canada has talked about the importance of carbon pricing as one of the important tools for addressing climate change. It\'s been codified in Canadian law already, but it hasn\'t been operationalized. We need to take seriously our obligations to future generations rather than just using it as a mantra or a buzzword.To get to net zero by 2025 would be quite ambitious. I don\'t think it\'s really feasible to do that quick of a transition to zero when we\'re at 700 right now. In Canada, we\'ve had a lot of plans and targets over the last 30 years. Since 1990, our greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 20%. Canada has not contributed to the GHG reduction effort, unlike its G7 partners.The cost of inaction is probably higher than the cost of action, as we have heard before. This is something that obliges us to act in a way that preserves our quality of life.There\'s reason to be optimistic for other reasons, too, in terms of society\'s understanding of the problem and the global momentum. It is possible to meet it; it\'s a question of will. Canada has had no shortage of commitments, but unfortunately has had a disappointing set of actions on climate change. The costs of action are significant. The cost of inaction are also significant. Unfortunately, because of decades of inaction, we don\'t have a status quo null alternative that we can continue on with.',4,'Mr. Jerry V. DeMarco'),

Some things are pretty tempting to get into because you know they\'re going to catch attention, but they may not get to the root cause of the problem.Public accounts committees across Canada meet at the same time as the auditors general. It\'s important to be able to ask the auditor what they looked at so you can fully understand the context of the findings. The original terminology used for what we now see in performance audits was value-for-money audits. Auditors want to determine not directly whether or not something was effective, but rather whether the ministry or organization has a system in place to determine its effectiveness. The three Es: economy, efficiency, effectiveness, environment, and equality.',2,'Ms. Carol Bellringer'),
(1521,451453793663982875,'The ultimate goal of the committee is to improve public administration and root out any waste of public funds. It is okay to ask the Auditor General to look into a given topic if the group is unanimous in requesting it. We do sometimes hear of witnesses coming in and some parliamentarians who will talk about wanting that to be a bad day or a bad week for that witness. I think we have a very hard-working public service for the most part. They do want to collaborate and improve things. They have worked with the audit office in advance of that audit report being published.The public accounts committee is different in how it operates. The key difference is that you are not looking at the merits of any policies; you are looking at how those policies have been implemented. The work you do on this committee will have a lasting impact on the programs and everything that follows them. It may sound like a tough job, but you\'re really not on your own. You have reliable, evidence-based, independent research from the Auditor General that\'s designed to identify any issues. These investigations take hundreds of hours of audit work and around $117 million annually.When you hold a hearing and you\'re asking those questions, you\'ll have two types of witnesses. One will often be the Auditor General, and one will be the audited department. What you really want to look at is whether they are implementing changes to address the issues that were identified in the audit, and whether that is going to improve public administration. There are a lot of ways of going about questioning, and we do an entire workshop on questioning. It\'s very helpful as a committee if you go into a hearing knowing the types of questions you want to ask.',2,'Ms. Lesley Burns'),
(1522,451453793663982877,'I want to know what you think are important questions for us regarding the annual public accounts the actual reports. Can you just give us a more fulsome definition? Especially on the performance audit, this is where the public accounts committee really distinguishes itself. I want to make it clear that there\'s a difference between oversight and management, right? I\'d like the witnesses to elaborate on this.My next question is about the three Es, which we can see on slide 17 of your document. The difference between economy, efficiency and effectiveness is explained.',2,'Mrs. Brenda Shanahan'),
(1523,451453793663982879,'I see that on page 25 of your presentation, under the heading Effective Questions , you say Focus on the big picture. I think you have touched on some of that, in terms of what is meant there, but can you share with the committee how you would define big picture ? If we were being advised to take the view from 30,000 feet, so to speak, what does that entail? What sort of things are we looking at in particular to get to that outcome?Thank you.',2,'Mr. Peter Fragiskatos'),

Having served one tour of duty on public accounts, I would say that after a little bit of a rough patch, I think we really found our stride towards the end of the Parliament. I can remember a committee meeting where, to the credit of the vice-chair, she was much more vehement with the questions than I was.',2,'Mr. Philip Lawrence'),

I just feel that a lot of times an emergency meeting is called not at this committee, of course, but other committees and at the end of it, nothing gets achieved.

Yes. As a newbie on this committee, and given the complexity and the uniqueness of the work that we do, I just wonder if you can recommend any additional training that could be undertaken and/or offered so that newcomers can get up to speed as quickly as possible and contribute in a meaningful fashion.',2,'Ms. Valerie Bradford'),
(1527,451453793663982887,'Mr. Dong: Even to a skilled practitioner, sometimes GC InfoBase is a bit of a tricky beast to manipulate. One thing I would recommend, if ever a member wishes to extract something, is to reach out to the library. We get numerous requests on this, and they\'re very good at that stuff. They know which tables the stuff is typically in and how to use it. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and thank you to everybody in attendance for your time.',2,'Mr. Dillan Theckedath'),

I\'m thinking of Crown corporations, for example, that follow international financial reporting standards, as opposed to departments, which have their own transparency standards. How can the committee request that these corporations present their data differently, and for study purposes, with reasonable objectives, of course?.
